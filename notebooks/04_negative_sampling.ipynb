Hi doctor,\\nMy dad has had recurring lung issues for the past 14 years. Several times, his chest X rays have shown his lungs so clouded they appeared completely opaque in all five lobes. In the two worst cases, he was diagnosed with acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS and placed on a ventilator for 14 and 10 days. Initially, pneumonia was suspected, but this diagnosis was revised after no fluid was found in the lungs, even with a bronchoscopy.\\nHe has type II diabetes, which made the ARDS very dangerous. Despite this, he was treated successfully with steroids, even though it carried risks for a diabetic. The Intensive care unit ICU focused on saving his life, but the root cause of his lung issues remains unknown. This is concerning because it has happened at least three times, and his chest X rays are still far from normal even four weeks after his ICU discharge.\\nSince moving to a post acute care facility, his oxygen saturation levels have dropped to around 86 twice. My mom has been checking it regularly at home for 14 years. His care has always been reactive, never proactive. There seems to be a pattern, as this happens about every 18 months.

       " 'Asperger syndrome is a developmental disorder that affects a person s ability to interact with others, understand the world, and behave. Hello doctor,I am a 30 year old male. I am not under any medications. I tried Lymecycline a couple of years ago and multiple creams for acne in the past. I have a history of mental health problems. I have a diagnosis of Asperger syndrome, OCD, anxiety, and depression. My anxiety levels have been chronic for many years due to the severity of my obsessive thoughts and compulsions etc. I think that my poor mental state has impacted on my health. I have had severe skin problems since I was about 17 or so. I get huge cysts that often recur in the same place with large boils. I have some large permanent cysts. I seem to break out at certain times. I also have a condition known as a functional neurological disorder. I will be seeing a neurologist here at a movement disorders clinic to deal with this in the near future. I also developed eyelash ptosis, where the eyelash in my right eye keeps growing long. My ophthalmologist told me that it needs to be trimmed regularly with scissors or that I have to use curlers, as it can impair my visual field. The neurological or psychological aspects may be affecting my other conditions. I have had athlete s foot for the past year. Due to my mental or neurological problems and depression, I have been housebound for most of the last year. I tend not to shower much or brush my teeth due to this.I walk around in my bare feet in the house most of the time, and when I do go out, I tend to wear footwear. The athlete s foot has become more itchy or burning recently. Also, for the past year or two, I have had two fungal nails. My big toes on both feet are very yellow looking at the front of the pins. I am concerned about my fingernails. About two weeks ago, I noticed that the middle finger on my right hand was very painful when I touched it. I cannot remember if I pulled the nail, and this has caused some infection, or if it is related in some way to the fungal nail infections on my toes or my athlete s foot. I will show you some pictures, and I would like your advice on what to do next. Due to my mental state, I have not taken good care of my body, but I am trying to address this. My athlete s foot is entirely wrong. If I start treating this with cream, I am likely to see an improvement. Also, what can I do about the fungal nails? I also have a pilonidal cyst on my tailbone. It was initially painful to sit down. This cyst is intermittent, but there are times when it can be very itchy. As you can see, I am not in the best shape, but I am trying to address both my mental health and my physical health by starting to take better care of myself, eating better, exercising, etc. The main concern is the fingernail. Do I have an infection? Can it be serious to blood flow losing limbs, or is this my anxiety and the things I search on the internet? I am quite concerned. I cannot see a doctor for another week or two. I have had this fingernail problem for about two weeks, and it is very sore and red.Thanks.',\n",

My father has had a triple bypass surgery for severely blocked arteries, and he has an abdominal aortic aneurysm that so far has responded well to two non open surgeries . When I first went in for the CT scan, the technician told me that I had an arrhythmia, with my heart rate jumping from the 70s to the 120s, and she recommended that my doctor prescribe a beta blocker. After taking Propranolol, my heart rate calmed down and I was able to have the scan. I have mast cell activation syndrome MCAS , which causes a lot of mostly bothersome, but sometimes fairly severe inflammatory symptoms. I assume that this may be related to that.

The most immediate question I have is whether the heart CT scan I just had shows anything below the aortic root. If it does not, then I am very curious about what the likelihood may be that the aorta could be more widely dilated farther down and whether the bulging of the aortic root makes it more likely that the thoracic and abdominal aorta could be likewise further dilated and potentially aneurysmal.

It is mostly itchy on my scalp, upper arms, and back. I have been on Telfast Fexofenadine hydrochloride to help with the itching and Daktacort Miconazole nitrate and Hydrocortisone to help with a red patch on my foreskin that my doctor said was thrush. Also, he thinks that the thrush may be the root cause of itchiness. The Daktacort has taken this patch down and almost goes away within a week but if I stop using the Daktacort the patch comes back. I have also developed a red spot on the tip of my foreskin, as well as two on the inside of my penis on the shaft. These are not itchy or sore but are just worrying to see as I am generally a healthy person. I also recently had an STI test which came back negative.

A 24 hour Holter monitor recorded heart rates ranging from tachycardia of up to 120 beats per minute to bradycardia with up to two seven second pauses per night. However, my condition was stable until about a year ago. My ejection fraction remains normal at 60 percent. I have scheduled an ablation procedure.Could you please explain the risks associated with such severe dilations and what interventions might help restore normal heart structure and function?',\n",

The palpitations are especially bad at night but also occur during the day when I am sitting and doing nothing. The palpitations often make me feel nauseous. On a scale of one to 10, they are about an eight. All lab results, including ECG, echo, and Holter monitor, are normal. My doctor could not figure out the cause and prescribed Propranolol 10 mg, telling me to take it once a day. Yesterday, after my doctor s visit, I had heart palpitations for four hours.

I finally slept without being woken up by palpitations, and I did not have to cough to stop them.

Despite this, all laboratory tests came back normal the next day. I also had carotid artery surgery two years ago to remove a piece of plaque from my right carotid artery.

       " 'A tic disorder is a repeated movement or sound that happens suddenly and cannot be controlled. Consult a doctor online to know more. Hi doctor,\\nMy 13 year old daughter developed a tic for about a month. And it started with a shoulder shrug one side, left shoulder and has progressed to several upper body tics. About six tics head jerking, shoulder shrug, arm jerk or extending, hand hitting thigh, hand hitting chest, and hand flap . Three vocal tics clicking, oooh sound, do you want some nickels? . They happen daily throughout the day. They do not interfere with her sleep. However, they do interfere with daily activities such as school and homework. I have noticed they are worse in stressful situations or when she is tired. The neurologist diagnosed her with tic disorder and prescribed medication. She had an EEG, which was normal. Is it typical for a child to develop tics as a teenager? Is it normal to have so many more than five develop in a short time? We were not given a reason or cause for the tics. Instead, the neurologist told us about 5 of children develop a tic, and of those 5 , 60 65 will stop having them before they are adults. Her neurologist prescribed Risperdal however, she has not started it yet. Should we get a second opinion, or does this seem like an acceptable explanation?',\n",

Hello doctor,\\nThe symptoms I experience include heart palpitations and continuous, nonstop neck cracking, which also causes pain in my cervical spine. I randomly have episodes of heart palpitations. One time, I suddenly jumped three feet out of bed, shocked by a rapid, hard heartbeat that lasted for seven seconds. That was scary. It felt as if my heart was going to burst out of my chest, and the beat extended up to my upper chest, throat, and neck. It was not the typical heartbeat we get from exercising it was a strange episode of palpitations. After that incident, I did not experience anything similar for months, maybe even a year. Then, I had another episode with the same intensity, but this time it lasted for 15 minutes, coming and going, accompanied only by sweating. Since then, I occasionally experience palpitations for one to two seconds while I am either sleeping or awake.

Hello doctor,\\nElevated blood pressure was first detected at age 18 and runs in the family on my maternal grandmother s side. It was never really treated until age 72 when it became a requirement for cataract surgery as per the anesthesiologist s request . I was prescribed Lisinopril 20 mg and Amlodipine 10 mg, which continued until age 76. During this period, the doctor altered the dosage and frequency as the medication gradually seemed to lose its effectiveness.At that point, intermittent episodes of a racing heartbeat and arrhythmia began to develop, accompanied by a total loss of stamina, sometimes with near fainting and nausea, after only five minutes of physical exertion. Based on an ECG, my PCP diagnosed this as atrial fibrillation a fib and referred me to a cardiologist. However, the cardiologist reviewed the same ECG and disagreed, stating that it was not a fib and that it could be one of several other conditions. He advised that, if it happens again, I should go straight to my PCP to have them perform another ECG and bring it back to him. This suggestion didn t seem very logical.Suspecting that the long term use of Amlodipine might have contributed, my PCP switched the medications to Verapamil 180 mg and Carvedilol 6.2 mg. For a while, these symptoms seemed to subside. During this time, I also experienced a ruptured Achilles tendon and a minor Lacunar stroke, which permanently disrupted the pressure sensitivity in the skin on my left side, from head to toe.About a year ago, the racing heartbeat and arrhythmia started to return intermittently. I subsequently discontinued all medication. The racing condition has now become more or less constant, with arrhythmia coming and going I can observe this using a mirror to view the right side of my neck . The lack of stamina seems permanent, and I also have slight swelling in my lower legs and feet, shortness of breath when reclining, and chronic insomnia.I am reluctant to involve my PCP again, as I expect the same routine a rushed examination they give him 11 minutes , a series of laboratory tests at the local hospital, and possibly another referral to the cardiologist, all likely resulting in the same outcome. While well intentioned, these providers are often not given enough time to thoroughly evaluate the problem and make a considered diagnosis.Please advise.',\n",
