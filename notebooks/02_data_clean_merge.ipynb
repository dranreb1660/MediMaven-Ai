       "  'answer': 'Keratoderma with woolly hair is a group of related conditions that affect the skin and hair and in many cases increase the risk of potentially life threatening heart problems. People with these conditions have hair that is unusually coarse, dry, fine, and tightly curled. In some cases, the hair is also sparse. The woolly hair texture typically affects only scalp hair and is present from birth. Starting early in life, affected individuals also develop palmoplantar keratoderma, a condition that causes skin on the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet to become thick, scaly, and calloused. Cardiomyopathy, which is a disease of the heart muscle, is a life threatening health problem that can develop in people with keratoderma with woolly hair. Unlike the other features of this condition, signs and symptoms of cardiomyopathy may not appear until adolescence or later. Complications of cardiomyopathy can include an abnormal heartbeat arrhythmia , heart failure, and sudden death. Keratoderma with woolly hair comprises several related conditions with overlapping signs and symptoms. Researchers have recently proposed classifying keratoderma with woolly hair into four types, based on the underlying genetic cause. Type I, also known as Naxos disease, is characterized by palmoplantar keratoderma, woolly hair, and a form of cardiomyopathy called arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy ARVC . Type II, also known as Carvajal syndrome, has hair and skin abnormalities similar to type I but features a different form of cardiomyopathy, called dilated left ventricular cardiomyopathy. Type III also has signs and symptoms similar to those of type I, including ARVC, although the hair and skin abnormalities are often milder. Type IV is characterized by palmoplantar keratoderma and woolly and sparse hair, as well as abnormal fingernails and toenails. Type IV does not appear to cause cardiomyopathy.',\n",

Since then, affected families have been found in other Greek islands, Turkey, and the Middle East. This form of the condition may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people from the Greek islands. Type II Carvajal syndrome , type III, and type IV have each been identified in only a small number of families worldwide.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mutations in the JUP, DSP, DSC2, and KANK2 genes cause keratoderma with woolly hair types I through IV, respectively. The JUP, DSP, and DSC2 genes provide instructions for making components of specialized cell structures called desmosomes. Desmosomes are located in the membrane surrounding certain cells, including skin and heart muscle cells. Desmosomes help attach cells to one another, which provides strength and stability to tissues. They also play a role in signaling between cells. Mutations in the JUP, DSP, or DSC2 gene alter the structure and impair the function of desmosomes. Abnormal or missing desmosomes prevent cells from sticking to one another effectively, which likely makes the hair, skin, and heart muscle more fragile. Over time, as these tissues are exposed to mechanical stress for example, friction on the surface of the skin or the constant contraction and relaxation of the heart muscle , they become damaged and can no longer function normally. This mechanism probably underlies the skin, hair, and heart problems that occur in keratoderma with woolly hair. Some studies suggest that abnormal cell signaling may also contribute to cardiomyopathy in people with this group of conditions. Unlike the other genes associated with keratoderma with woolly hair, the KANK2 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is not part of desmosomes. Instead, it regulates other proteins called steroid receptor coactivators SRCs , whose function is to help turn on activate certain genes. SRCs play important roles in tissues throughout the body, including the skin. Studies suggest that mutations in the KANK2 gene disrupt the regulation of SRCs, which leads to abnormal gene activity. However, it is unclear how these changes underlie the skin and hair abnormalities in keratoderma with woolly hair type IV.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Knobloch syndrome is a rare condition characterized by severe vision problems and a skull defect. A characteristic feature of Knobloch syndrome is extreme nearsightedness high myopia . In addition, several other eye abnormalities are common in people with this condition. Most affected individuals have vitreoretinal degeneration, which is breakdown degeneration of two structures in the eye called the vitreous and the retina. The vitreous is the gelatin like substance that fills the eye, and the retina is the light sensitive tissue at the back of the eye. Vitreoretinal degeneration often leads to separation of the retina from the back of the eye retinal detachment . Affected individuals may also have abnormalities in the central area of the retina, called the macula. The macula is responsible for sharp central vision, which is needed for detailed tasks such as reading, driving, and recognizing faces. Due to abnormalities in the vitreous, retina, and macula, people with Knobloch syndrome often develop blindness in one or both eyes. Another characteristic feature of Knobloch syndrome is a skull defect called an occipital encephalocele, which is a sac like protrusion of the brain encephalocele through a defect in the bone at the base of the skull occipital bone . Some affected individuals have been diagnosed with a different skull defect in the occipital region, and it is unclear whether the defect is always a true encephalocele. In other conditions, encephaloceles may be associated with intellectual disability however, most people with Knobloch syndrome have normal intelligence.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mutations in the COL18A1 gene can cause Knobloch syndrome. The COL18A1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that forms collagen XVIII, which is found in the basement membranes of tissues throughout the body. Basement membranes are thin, sheet like structures that separate and support cells in these tissues. Collagen XVIII is found in the basement membranes of several parts of the eye, including the vitreous and retina, among other tissues. Little is known about the function of this protein, but it appears to be involved in normal development of the eye. Several mutations in the COL18A1 gene have been identified in people with Knobloch syndrome. Most COL18A1 gene mutations lead to an abnormally short version of the genetic blueprint used to make the collagen XVIII protein. Although the process is unclear, the COL18A1 gene mutations result in the loss of collagen XVIII protein, which likely causes the signs and symptoms of Knobloch syndrome. When the condition is caused by COL18A1 gene mutations, it is sometimes referred to as Knobloch syndrome type I. Research indicates that mutations in at least two other genes that have not been identified may cause Knobloch syndrome types II and III. Although they are caused by alterations in different genes, the three types of the condition have similar signs and symptoms.',\n",

They may appear as notches or gaps in one of several parts of the eye, including the colored part of the eye called the iris the retina, which is the specialized light sensitive tissue that lines the back of the eye the blood vessel layer under the retina called the choroid or the optic nerves, which carry information from the eyes to the brain. Colobomas may be present in one or both eyes and, depending on their size and location, can affect a person s vision. Colobomas affecting the iris, which result in a keyhole appearance of the pupil, generally do not lead to vision loss. Colobomas involving the retina result in vision loss in specific parts of the visual field, generally the upper part. Large retinal colobomas or those affecting the optic nerve can cause low vision, which means vision loss that cannot be completely corrected with glasses or contact lenses. Some people with coloboma also have a condition called microphthalmia. In this condition, one or both eyeballs are abnormally small. In some affected individuals, the eyeball may appear to be completely missing however, even in these cases some remaining eye tissue is generally present. Such severe microphthalmia should be distinguished from another condition called anophthalmia, in which no eyeball forms at all. However, the terms anophthalmia and severe microphthalmia are often used interchangeably. Microphthalmia may or may not result in significant vision loss. People with coloboma may also have other eye abnormalities, including clouding of the lens of the eye cataract , increased pressure inside the eye glaucoma that can damage the optic nerve, vision problems such as nearsightedness myopia , involuntary back and forth eye movements nystagmus , or separation of the retina from the back of the eye retinal detachment . Some individuals have coloboma as part of a syndrome that affects other organs and tissues in the body. These forms of the condition are described as syndromic. When coloboma occurs by itself, it is described as nonsyndromic or isolated. Colobomas involving the eyeball should be distinguished from gaps that occur in the eyelids. While these eyelid gaps are also called colobomas, they arise from abnormalities in different structures during early development.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Coloboma arises from abnormal development of the eye. During the second month of development before birth, a seam called the optic fissure also known as the choroidal fissure or embryonic fissure closes to form the structures of the eye. When the optic fissure does not close completely, the result is a coloboma. The location of the coloboma depends on the part of the optic fissure that failed to close. Coloboma may be caused by changes in many genes involved in the early development of the eye, most of which have not been identified. The condition may also result from a chromosomal abnormality affecting one or more genes. Most genetic changes associated with coloboma have been identified only in very small numbers of affected individuals. The risk of coloboma may also be increased by environmental factors that affect early development, such as exposure to alcohol during pregnancy. In these cases, affected individuals usually have other health problems in addition to coloboma.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Most often, isolated coloboma is not inherited, and there is only one affected individual in a family. However, the affected individual is still at risk of passing the coloboma on to his or her own children. In cases when it is passed down in families, coloboma can have different inheritance patterns. Isolated coloboma is sometimes inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of an altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. Isolated coloboma can also be inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of a gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of a mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition. Less commonly, isolated coloboma may have X linked dominant or X linked recessive patterns of inheritance. X linked means that a gene associated with this condition is located on the X chromosome, which is one of the two sex chromosomes. A characteristic of X linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass X linked traits to their sons. X linked dominant means that in females who have two X chromosomes , a mutation in one of the two copies of a gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In males who have only one X chromosome , a mutation in the only copy of a gene in each cell causes the disorder. In most cases, males experience more severe symptoms of the disorder than females. X linked recessive means that in females, a mutation would have to occur in both copies of a gene to cause the disorder. In males, one altered copy of a gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. Because it is unlikely that females will have two altered copies of a particular gene, males are affected by X linked recessive disorders much more frequently than females. When coloboma occurs as a feature of a genetic syndrome or chromosomal abnormality, it may cluster in families according to the inheritance pattern for that condition, which may be autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or X linked.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Lacrimo auriculo dento digital LADD syndrome is a genetic disorder that mainly affects the eyes, ears, mouth, and hands. LADD syndrome is characterized by defects in the tear producing lacrimal system lacrimo , ear problems auriculo , dental abnormalities dento , and deformities of the fingers digital . The lacrimal system consists of structures in the eye that produce and secrete tears. Lacrimal system malformations that can occur with LADD syndrome include an underdeveloped or absent opening to the tear duct at the edge of the eyelid lacrimal puncta and blockage of the channel nasolacrimal duct that connects the inside corner of the eye where tears gather tear sac to the nasal cavity. These malformations of the lacrimal system can lead to chronic tearing epiphora , inflammation of the tear sac dacryocystitis , inflammation of the front surface of the eye keratoconjunctivitis , or an inability to produce tears. Ears that are low set and described as cup shaped, often accompanied by hearing loss, are a common feature of LADD syndrome. The hearing loss may be mild to severe and can be caused by changes in the inner ear sensorineural deafness , changes in the middle ear conductive hearing loss , or both mixed hearing loss . People with LADD syndrome may have underdeveloped or absent salivary glands, which impairs saliva production. A decrease in saliva leads to dry mouth xerostomia and a greater susceptibility to cavities. Individuals with LADD syndrome often have small, underdeveloped teeth with thin enamel and peg shaped front teeth incisors . Hand deformities are also a frequent feature of LADD syndrome. Affected individuals may have abnormally small or missing thumbs. Alternatively, the thumb might be duplicated, fused with the index finger syndactyly , abnormally placed, or have three bones instead of the normal two and resemble a finger. Abnormalities of the fingers include syndactyly of the second and third fingers, extra or missing fingers, and curved pinky fingers fifth finger clinodactyly . Sometimes, the forearm is also affected. It can be shorter than normal with abnormal wrist and elbow joint development that limits movement. People with LADD syndrome may also experience other signs and symptoms. They can have kidney problems that include hardening of the kidneys nephrosclerosis and urine accumulation in the kidneys hydronephrosis , which can impair kidney function. Recurrent urinary tract infections and abnormalities of the genitourinary system can also occur. Some people with LADD syndrome have an opening in the roof of the mouth cleft palate with or without a split in the upper lip cleft lip . The signs and symptoms of this condition vary widely, even among affected family members.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mutations in the FGFR2, FGFR3, or FGF10 gene can cause LADD syndrome. The FGFR2 and FGFR3 genes provide instructions for making proteins that are part of a family called fibroblast growth factor receptors. The FGF10 gene provides instructions for making a protein called a fibroblast growth factor, which is a family of proteins that attaches binds to fibroblast growth factor receptors. The receptors are located within the membranes of cells, where they receive signals that control growth and development from growth factors outside the cell. The signals triggered by the FGFR2, FGFR3, and FGF10 genes appear to stimulate cells to form the structures that make up the lacrimal glands, salivary glands, ears, skeleton, and many other organs. Mutations in the FGFR2, FGFR3, or FGF10 gene alter the proteins produced from these genes and disrupt the signaling within cells. As a result, cell maturation and development is impaired and the formation of many tissues is affected, leading to the signs and symptoms of LADD syndrome.',\n",

People with this condition initially experience problems with coordination and balance ataxia . Other early signs and symptoms of SCA3 include speech difficulties, uncontrolled muscle tensing dystonia , muscle stiffness spasticity , rigidity, tremors, bulging eyes, and double vision. People with this condition may experience sleep disorders such as restless leg syndrome or REM sleep behavior disorder. Restless leg syndrome is a condition characterized by numbness or tingling in the legs accompanied by an urge to move the legs to stop the sensations. REM sleep behavior disorder is a condition in which the muscles are active during the dream REM stage of sleep, so an affected person often acts out his or her dreams. These sleep disorders tend to leave affected individuals feeling tired during the day. Over time, individuals with SCA3 may develop loss of sensation and weakness in the limbs peripheral neuropathy , muscle cramps, muscle twitches fasciculations , and swallowing difficulties. Individuals with SCA3 may have problems with memory, planning, and problem solving. Signs and symptoms of the disorder typically begin in mid adulthood but can appear anytime from childhood to late adulthood. People with SCA3 eventually require wheelchair assistance.

       "  'answer': 'Mutations in the ATXN3 gene cause SCA3. The ATXN3 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called ataxin 3, which is found in cells throughout the body. Ataxin 3 is involved in a mechanism called the ubiquitin proteasome system that destroys and gets rid of excess or damaged proteins. The molecule ubiquitin is attached bound to unneeded proteins, which tags them to be broken down degraded within cells. Ataxin 3 removes the ubiquitin from these unwanted proteins just before they are degraded so that the ubiquitin can be used again. Researchers believe that ataxin 3 also may be involved in regulating the first stage of protein production transcription . The ATXN3 gene mutations that cause SCA3 involve a DNA segment known as a CAG trinucleotide repeat. This segment is made up of a series of three DNA building blocks cytosine, adenine, and guanine that appear multiple times in a row. Normally, the CAG segment is repeated 12 to 43 times within the gene. Most people have fewer than 31 CAG repeats. In people with SCA3, the CAG segment is repeated more than 50 times. People who have 44 to 52 CAG repeats are described as having an intermediate repeat. These individuals may or may not develop SCA3. People with 75 or fewer repeats tend to first experience signs and symptoms of SCA3 in mid adulthood, while people with around 80 repeats usually have signs and symptoms by their teens. An increase in the length of the CAG segment leads to the production of an abnormally long version of the ataxin 3 enzyme that folds into the wrong 3 dimensional shape. This nonfunctional ataxin 3 enzyme cannot remove ubiquitin from proteins that are no longer needed. As a result, these unwanted proteins, along with ubiquitin and ataxin 3, cluster together to form clumps aggregates within the nucleus of the cells. It is unclear how these aggregates affect cell function, because they are found in healthy cells as well as those that die. Nerve cells neurons and other types of brain cells are most affected by mutations in the ATXN3 gene. SCA3 is associated with cell death in the part of the brain that is connected to the spinal cord the brainstem , the part of the brain involved in coordinating movements the cerebellum , and other areas of the brain. This condition is also associated with the death of neurons in the spinal cord. Over time, the loss of cells in the brain and spinal cord cause the signs and symptoms characteristic of SCA3.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'This condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In most cases, an affected person has one parent with the condition. As the altered ATXN3 gene is passed down from one generation to the next, the length of the CAG trinucleotide repeat often increases. A larger number of repeats is usually associated with an earlier onset of signs and symptoms. This phenomenon is called anticipation. Anticipation tends to be more prominent when the ATXN3 gene is inherited from a person s father paternal inheritance than when it is inherited from a person s mother maternal inheritance . In rare cases, individuals have been reported with expanded CAG repeats on both copies of the ATXN3 gene in each cell.

       "  'answer': 'Pilomatricoma, also known as pilomatrixoma, is a type of noncancerous benign skin tumor associated with hair follicles. Hair follicles are specialized structures in the skin where hair growth occurs. Pilomatricomas occur most often on the head or neck, although they can also be found on the arms, torso, or legs. A pilomatricoma feels like a small, hard lump under the skin. This type of tumor grows relatively slowly and usually does not cause pain or other symptoms. Most affected individuals have a single tumor, although rarely multiple pilomatricomas can occur. If a pilomatricoma is removed surgically, it tends not to grow back recur . Most pilomatricomas occur in people under the age of 20. However, these tumors can also appear later in life. Almost all pilomatricomas are benign, but a very small percentage are cancerous malignant . Unlike the benign form, the malignant version of this tumor known as a pilomatrix carcinoma occurs most often in middle age or late in life. Pilomatricoma usually occurs without other signs or symptoms isolated , but this type of tumor has also rarely been reported with inherited conditions. Disorders that can be associated with pilomatricoma include Gardner syndrome, which is characterized by multiple growths polyps and cancers of the colon and rectum myotonic dystrophy, which is a form of muscular dystrophy and Rubinstein Taybi syndrome, which is a condition that affects many parts of the body and is associated with an increased risk of both benign and malignant tumors.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mutations in the CTNNB1 gene are found in almost all cases of isolated pilomatricoma. These mutations are somatic, which means they are acquired during a person s lifetime and are present only in tumor cells. Somatic mutations are not inherited. The CTNNB1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called beta catenin. This protein plays an important role in sticking cells together cell adhesion and in communication between cells. It is also involved in cell signaling as part of the WNT signaling pathway. This pathway promotes the growth and division proliferation of cells and helps determine the specialized functions a cell will have differentiation . WNT signaling is involved in many aspects of development before birth, as well as the maintenance and repair of adult tissues. Among its many activities, beta catenin appears to be necessary for the normal function of hair follicles. This protein is active in cells that make up a part of the hair follicle known as the matrix. These cells divide and mature to form the different components of the hair follicle and the hair shaft. As matrix cells divide, the hair shaft is pushed upward and extends beyond the skin. Mutations in the CTNNB1 gene lead to a version of beta catenin that is always turned on constitutively active . The overactive protein triggers matrix cells to divide too quickly and in an uncontrolled way, leading to the formation of a pilomatricoma. Most pilomatrix carcinomas, the malignant version of pilomatricoma, also have somatic mutations in the CTNNB1 gene. It is unclear why some pilomatricomas are cancerous but most others are not.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Stickler syndrome is a group of hereditary conditions characterized by a distinctive facial appearance, eye abnormalities, hearing loss, and joint problems. These signs and symptoms vary widely among affected individuals. A characteristic feature of Stickler syndrome is a somewhat flattened facial appearance. This appearance results from underdeveloped bones in the middle of the face, including the cheekbones and the bridge of the nose. A particular group of physical features called Pierre Robin sequence is also common in people with Stickler syndrome. Pierre Robin sequence includes an opening in the roof of the mouth a cleft palate , a tongue that is placed further back than normal glossoptosis , and a small lower jaw micrognathia . This combination of features can lead to feeding problems and difficulty breathing. Many people with Stickler syndrome have severe nearsightedness high myopia . In some cases, the clear gel that fills the eyeball the vitreous has an abnormal appearance, which is noticeable during an eye examination. Other eye problems are also common, including increased pressure within the eye glaucoma , clouding of the lens of the eyes cataracts , and tearing of the lining of the eye retinal detachment . These eye abnormalities cause impaired vision or blindness in some cases. In people with Stickler syndrome, hearing loss varies in degree and may become more severe over time. The hearing loss may be sensorineural, meaning that it results from changes in the inner ear, or conductive, meaning that it is caused by abnormalities of the middle ear. Most people with Stickler syndrome have skeletal abnormalities that affect the joints. The joints of affected children and young adults may be loose and very flexible hypermobile , though joints become less flexible with age. Arthritis often appears early in life and may cause joint pain or stiffness. Problems with the bones of the spine vertebrae can also occur, including abnormal curvature of the spine scoliosis or kyphosis and flattened vertebrae platyspondyly . These spinal abnormalities may cause back pain. Researchers have described several types of Stickler syndrome, which are distinguished by their genetic causes and their patterns of signs and symptoms. In particular, the eye abnormalities and severity of hearing loss differ among the types. Type I has the highest risk of retinal detachment. Type II also includes eye abnormalities, but type III does not and is often called non ocular Stickler syndrome . Types II and III are more likely than type I to have significant hearing loss. Types IV, V, and VI are very rare and have each been diagnosed in only a few individuals. A condition similar to Stickler syndrome, called Marshall syndrome, is characterized by a distinctive facial appearance, eye abnormalities, hearing loss, and early onset arthritis. Marshall syndrome can also include short stature. Some researchers have classified Marshall syndrome as a variant of Stickler syndrome, while others consider it to be a separate disorder.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mutations in several genes cause the different types of Stickler syndrome. Between 80 and 90 percent of all cases are classified as type I and are caused by mutations in the COL2A1 gene. Another 10 to 20 percent of cases are classified as type II and result from mutations in the COL11A1 gene. Marshall syndrome, which may be a variant of Stickler syndrome, is also caused by COL11A1 gene mutations. Stickler syndrome types III through VI result from mutations in other, related genes. All of the genes associated with Stickler syndrome provide instructions for making components of collagens, which are complex molecules that give structure and strength to the connective tissues that support the body s joints and organs. Mutations in any of these genes impair the production, processing, or assembly of collagen molecules. Defective collagen molecules or reduced amounts of collagen impair the development of connective tissues in many different parts of the body, leading to the varied features of Stickler syndrome. Not all individuals with Stickler syndrome have mutations in one of the known genes. Researchers believe that mutations in other genes may also cause this condition, but those genes have not been identified.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'T cell immunodeficiency, congenital alopecia, and nail dystrophy is a type of severe combined immunodeficiency SCID , which is a group of disorders characterized by an almost total lack of immune protection from foreign invaders such as bacteria and viruses. People with this form of SCID are missing functional immune cells called T cells, which normally recognize and attack foreign invaders to prevent infection. Without functional T cells, affected individuals develop repeated and persistent infections starting early in life. The infections result in slow growth and can be life threatening without effective treatment, most affected individuals live only into infancy or early childhood. T cell immunodeficiency, congenital alopecia, and nail dystrophy also affects growth of the hair and nails. Congenital alopecia refers to an absence of hair that is apparent from birth. Affected individuals have no scalp hair, eyebrows, or eyelashes. Nail dystrophy is a general term that describes malformed fingernails and toenails in this condition, the nails are often ridged, pitted, or abnormally curved. Researchers have described abnormalities of the brain and spinal cord central nervous system in at least two cases of this condition. However, it is not yet known whether central nervous system abnormalities are a common feature of T cell immunodeficiency, congenital alopecia, and nail dystrophy.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'T cell immunodeficiency, congenital alopecia, and nail dystrophy results from mutations in the FOXN1 gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein that is important for development of the skin, hair, nails, and immune system. Studies suggest that this protein helps guide the formation of hair follicles and the growth of fingernails and toenails. The FOXN1 protein also plays a critical role in the formation of the thymus, which is a gland located behind the breastbone where T cells mature and become functional. Researchers suspect that the FOXN1 protein is also involved in the development of the central nervous system, although its role is unclear. Mutations in the FOXN1 gene prevent cells from making any functional FOXN1 protein. Without this protein, hair and nails cannot grow normally. A lack of FOXN1 protein also prevents the formation of the thymus. When this gland is not present, the immune system cannot produce mature, functional T cells to fight infections. As a result, people with T cell immunodeficiency, congenital alopecia, and nail dystrophy develop recurrent serious infections starting early in life.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Timothy syndrome is a rare disorder that affects many parts of the body including the heart, digits fingers and toes , and the nervous system. Timothy syndrome is characterized by a heart condition called long QT syndrome, which causes the heart cardiac muscle to take longer than usual to recharge between beats. This abnormality in the heart s electrical system can cause irregular heartbeats arrhythmia , which can lead to sudden death. Many people with Timothy syndrome are also born with structural heart defects that affect the heart s ability to pump blood effectively. As a result of these serious heart problems, many people with Timothy syndrome live only into childhood. The most common cause of death is a form of arrhythmia called ventricular tachyarrhythmia, in which the lower chambers of the heart the ventricles beat abnormally fast and lead to cardiac arrest. Timothy syndrome is also characterized by webbing or fusion of the skin between some fingers or toes cutaneous syndactyly . About half of affected people have distinctive facial features such as a flattened nasal bridge, low set ears, a small upper jaw, and a thin upper lip. Children with this condition have small, misplaced teeth and frequent cavities dental caries . Additional signs and symptoms of Timothy syndrome can include baldness at birth, frequent infections, episodes of low blood sugar hypoglycemia , and an abnormally low body temperature hypothermia . Researchers have found that many children with Timothy syndrome have the characteristic features of autism or similar conditions known as autistic spectrum disorders. Affected children tend to have impaired communication and socialization skills, as well as delayed development of speech and language. Other nervous system abnormalities, including intellectual disability and seizures, can also occur in children with Timothy syndrome. Researchers have identified two forms of Timothy syndrome. Type 1, which is also known as the classic type, includes all of the characteristic features described above. Type 2, or the atypical type, causes a more severe form of long QT syndrome and a greater risk of arrhythmia and sudden death. Unlike the classic type, the atypical type does not appear to cause webbing of the fingers or toes.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mutations in the CACNA1C gene are responsible for all reported cases of Timothy syndrome. This gene provides instructions for making a protein that acts as a channel across cell membranes. This channel, known as CaV1.2, is one of several channels that transport positively charged calcium atoms calcium ions into cells. Calcium ions are involved in many different cellular functions, including cell to cell communication, the tensing of muscle fibers muscle contraction , and the regulation of certain genes. CaV1.2 calcium channels are particularly important for the normal function of heart and brain cells. In cardiac muscle, these channels play a critical role in maintaining the heart s normal rhythm. Their role in the brain and in other tissues is less clear. Mutations in the CACNA1C gene change the structure of CaV1.2 channels. The altered channels stay open much longer than usual, which allows calcium ions to continue flowing into cells abnormally. The resulting overload of calcium ions within cardiac muscle cells changes the way the heart beats and can cause arrhythmia. Researchers are working to determine how an increase in calcium ion transport in other tissues, including cells in the brain, underlies the other features of Timothy syndrome.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Most cases of trisomy 18 result from having three copies of chromosome 18 in each cell in the body instead of the usual two copies. The extra genetic material disrupts the normal course of development, causing the characteristic features of trisomy 18. Approximately 5 percent of people with trisomy 18 have an extra copy of chromosome 18 in only some of the body s cells. In these people, the condition is called mosaic trisomy 18. The severity of mosaic trisomy 18 depends on the type and number of cells that have the extra chromosome. The development of individuals with this form of trisomy 18 may range from normal to severely affected. Very rarely, part of the long q arm of chromosome 18 becomes attached translocated to another chromosome during the formation of reproductive cells eggs and sperm or very early in embryonic development. Affected individuals have two copies of chromosome 18, plus the extra material from chromosome 18 attached to another chromosome. People with this genetic change are said to have partial trisomy 18. If only part of the q arm is present in three copies, the physical signs of partial trisomy 18 may be less severe than those typically seen in trisomy 18. If the entire q arm is present in three copies, individuals may be as severely affected as if they had three full copies of chromosome 18.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Most cases of trisomy 18 are not inherited, but occur as random events during the formation of eggs and sperm. An error in cell division called nondisjunction results in a reproductive cell with an abnormal number of chromosomes. For example, an egg or sperm cell may gain an extra copy of chromosome 18. If one of these atypical reproductive cells contributes to the genetic makeup of a child, the child will have an extra chromosome 18 in each of the body s cells. Mosaic trisomy 18 is also not inherited. It occurs as a random event during cell division early in embryonic development. As a result, some of the body s cells have the usual two copies of chromosome 18, and other cells have three copies of this chromosome. Partial trisomy 18 can be inherited. An unaffected person can carry a rearrangement of genetic material between chromosome 18 and another chromosome. This rearrangement is called a balanced translocation because there is no extra material from chromosome 18. Although they do not have signs of trisomy 18, people who carry this type of balanced translocation are at an increased risk of having children with the condition.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Aicardi Goutieres syndrome is a disorder that mainly affects the brain, the immune system, and the skin. Most newborns with Aicardi Goutieres syndrome do not show any signs or symptoms of the disorder at birth. However, about 20 percent are born with a combination of features that include an enlarged liver and spleen hepatosplenomegaly , elevated blood levels of liver enzymes, a decrease in blood platelets thrombocytopenia , and abnormal neurological responses. While this combination of signs and symptoms is typically associated with the immune system s response to congenital viral infection, no actual infection is found in these infants. For this reason, Aicardi Goutieres syndrome is sometimes referred to as a mimic of congenital infection. Within the first year of life most individuals with Aicardi Goutieres syndrome experience an episode of severe brain dysfunction encephalopathy , typically lasting for several months. During this phase of the disorder, affected babies are usually extremely irritable and do not feed well. They may develop intermittent fevers in the absence of infection sterile pyrexias and may have seizures. They stop developing new skills and begin losing skills they had already acquired developmental regression . Growth of the brain and skull slows down, resulting in an abnormally small head size microcephaly . In this phase of the disorder, white blood cells and molecules associated with inflammation can be detected in the cerebrospinal fluid, which is the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord central nervous system . These abnormal findings are consistent with inflammation and tissue damage in the central nervous system. The encephalopathic phase of Aicardi Goutieres syndrome leaves behind permanent neurological damage that is usually severe. Medical imaging reveals deterioration of white matter in the brain leukodystrophy . White matter consists of nerve fibers covered by myelin, which is a substance that insulates and protects nerves. Affected individuals also have abnormal deposits of calcium calcification in the brain. Most people with Aicardi Goutieres syndrome have profound intellectual disability. They also have significant neuromuscular problems including muscle stiffness spasticity involuntary tensing of various muscles dystonia , especially those in the arms and weak muscle tone hypotonia in the trunk. About 40 percent of people with Aicardi Goutieres syndrome have painful, itchy skin lesions, usually on the fingers, toes, and ears. These puffy, red lesions, which are called chilblains, are caused by inflammation of small blood vessels. They may be brought on or made worse by exposure to cold. Vision problems, joint stiffness, and mouth ulcers may also occur in this disorder. As a result of the severe neurological problems usually associated with Aicardi Goutieres syndrome, most people with this disorder do not survive past childhood. However, some affected individuals who have later onset and milder neurological problems may live into adulthood.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mutations in the TREX1, RNASEH2A, RNASEH2B, RNASEH2C, and SAMHD1 genes have been identified in people with Aicardi Goutieres syndrome. The TREX1, RNASEH2A, RNASEH2B, and RNASEH2C genes provide instructions for making nucleases, which are enzymes that help break up molecules of DNA and its chemical cousin RNA. Mutations in any of these genes are believed to result in an absent or dysfunctional nuclease enzyme. Researchers suggest that absent or impaired enzyme function may result in the accumulation of unneeded DNA and RNA in cells. These DNA and RNA molecules or fragments may be generated during the first stage of protein production transcription , copying replication of cells genetic material in preparation for cell division, DNA repair, cell death, and other processes. The unneeded DNA and RNA may be mistaken by cells for that of viral invaders, triggering immune system reactions that result in encephalopathy, skin lesions, and other signs and symptoms of Aicardi Goutieres syndrome. The SAMHD1 gene provides instructions for making a protein whose function is not well understood however, it is believed to be involved in the immune system and the inflammatory process. Mutations in this gene likely result in a protein that does not function properly, resulting in immune system abnormalities, inflammatory damage to the brain and skin, and other characteristics of Aicardi Goutieres syndrome.',\n",

Hand abnormalities are common in this syndrome and include short fingers brachydactyly , curved pinky fingers fifth finger clinodactyly , webbing of the skin between some fingers syndactyly , and a single crease across the palm. Some people with Aarskog Scott syndrome are born with more serious abnormalities, such as heart defects or a cleft lip with or without an opening in the roof of the mouth cleft palate . Most males with Aarskog Scott syndrome have a shawl scrotum, in which the scrotum surrounds the penis. Less often, they have undescended testes cryptorchidism or a soft out pouching around the belly button umbilical hernia or in the lower abdomen inguinal hernia .

The gene associated with this condition is located on the X chromosome, which is one of the two sex chromosomes. In males who have only one X chromosome , one altered copy of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. In females who have two X chromosomes , a mutation would have to occur in both copies of the gene to cause Aarskog Scott syndrome.

The GLI3 gene provides instructions for making a protein that controls gene expression, which is a process that regulates whether genes are turned on or off in particular cells. By interacting with certain genes at specific times during development, the GLI3 protein plays a role in the normal shaping patterning of many organs and tissues before birth. Mutations that cause Pallister Hall syndrome typically lead to the production of an abnormally short version of the GLI3 protein. Unlike the normal GLI3 protein, which can turn target genes on or off, the short protein can only turn off repress target genes.

       "  'answer': 'Parkinson disease is a progressive disorder of the nervous system. The disorder affects several regions of the brain, especially an area called the substantia nigra that controls balance and movement. Often the first symptom of Parkinson disease is trembling or shaking tremor of a limb, especially when the body is at rest. Typically, the tremor begins on one side of the body, usually in one hand. Tremors can also affect the arms, legs, feet, and face. Other characteristic symptoms of Parkinson disease include rigidity or stiffness of the limbs and torso, slow movement bradykinesia or an inability to move akinesia , and impaired balance and coordination postural instability . These symptoms worsen slowly over time. Parkinson disease can also affect emotions and thinking ability cognition . Some affected individuals develop psychiatric conditions such as depression and visual hallucinations. People with Parkinson disease also have an increased risk of developing dementia, which is a decline in intellectual functions including judgment and memory. Generally, Parkinson disease that begins after age 50 is called late onset disease. The condition is described as early onset disease if signs and symptoms begin before age 50. Early onset cases that begin before age 20 are sometimes referred to as juvenile onset Parkinson disease.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Most cases of Parkinson disease probably result from a complex interaction of environmental and genetic factors. These cases are classified as sporadic and occur in people with no apparent history of the disorder in their family. The cause of these sporadic cases remains unclear. Approximately 15 percent of people with Parkinson disease have a family history of this disorder. Familial cases of Parkinson disease can be caused by mutations in the LRRK2, PARK2, PARK7, PINK1, or SNCA gene, or by alterations in genes that have not been identified. Mutations in some of these genes may also play a role in cases that appear to be sporadic not inherited . Alterations in certain genes, including GBA and UCHL1, do not cause Parkinson disease but appear to modify the risk of developing the condition in some families. Variations in other genes that have not been identified probably also contribute to Parkinson disease risk. It is not fully understood how genetic changes cause Parkinson disease or influence the risk of developing the disorder. Many Parkinson disease symptoms occur when nerve cells neurons in the substantia nigra die or become impaired. Normally, these cells produce a chemical messenger called dopamine, which transmits signals within the brain to produce smooth physical movements. When these dopamine producing neurons are damaged or die, communication between the brain and muscles weakens. Eventually, the brain becomes unable to control muscle movement. Some gene mutations appear to disturb the cell machinery that breaks down degrades unwanted proteins in dopamine producing neurons. As a result, undegraded proteins accumulate, leading to the impairment or death of these cells. Other mutations may affect the function of mitochondria, the energy producing structures within cells. As a byproduct of energy production, mitochondria make unstable molecules called free radicals that can damage cells. Cells normally counteract the effects of free radicals before they cause damage, but mutations can disrupt this process. As a result, free radicals may accumulate and impair or kill dopamine producing neurons. In most cases of Parkinson disease, protein deposits called Lewy bodies appear in dead or dying dopamine producing neurons. When Lewy bodies are not present, the condition is sometimes referred to as parkinsonism. It is unclear whether Lewy bodies play a role in killing nerve cells or if they are part of the cells response to the disease.',\n",

In most cases, an affected person has one parent with the condition. If the PARK2, PARK7, or PINK1 gene is involved, Parkinson disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. This type of inheritance means that two copies of the gene in each cell are altered. Most often, the parents of an individual with autosomal recessive Parkinson disease each carry one copy of the altered gene but do not show signs and symptoms of the disorder. When genetic alterations modify the risk of developing Parkinson disease, the inheritance pattern is usually unknown.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'ADCY5 related dyskinesia is a movement disorder the term dyskinesia refers to abnormal involuntary movements. The abnormal movements that occur in ADCY5 related dyskinesia typically appear as sudden paroxysmal jerks, twitches, tremors, muscle tensing dystonia , or writhing choreiform movements, and can affect the limbs, neck, and face. The abnormal movements associated with ADCY5 related dyskinesia usually begin between infancy and late adolescence. They can occur continually during waking hours and in some cases also during sleep. Severely affected infants may experience weak muscle tone hypotonia and delay in development of motor skills such as crawling and walking these individuals may have difficulties with activities of daily living and may eventually require a wheelchair. In more mildly affected individuals, the condition has little impact on walking and other motor skills, although the abnormal movements can lead to clumsiness or difficulty with social acceptance in school or other situations. In some people with ADCY5 related dyskinesia, the disorder is generally stable throughout their lifetime. In others, it slowly gets worse progresses in both frequency and severity before stabilizing or even improving in middle age. Anxiety, fatigue, and other stress can temporarily increase the severity of the signs and symptoms of ADCY5 related dyskinesia, while some affected individuals may experience remission periods of days or weeks without abnormal movements. Life expectancy and intelligence are unaffected by this disorder.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Proopiomelanocortin POMC deficiency causes severe obesity that begins at an early age. In addition to obesity, people with this condition have low levels of a hormone known as adrenocorticotropic hormone ACTH and tend to have red hair and pale skin. Affected infants are usually a normal weight at birth, but they are constantly hungry, which leads to excessive feeding hyperphagia . The babies continuously gain weight and are severely obese by age 1. Affected individuals experience excessive hunger and remain obese for life. It is unclear if these individuals are prone to weight related conditions like cardiovascular disease or type 2 diabetes. Low levels of ACTH lead to a condition called adrenal insufficiency, which occurs when the pair of small glands on top of the kidneys the adrenal glands do not produce enough hormones. Adrenal insufficiency often results in periods of severely low blood sugar hypoglycemia in people with POMC deficiency, which can cause seizures, elevated levels of a toxic substance called bilirubin in the blood hyperbilirubinemia , and a reduced ability to produce and release a digestive fluid called bile cholestasis . Without early treatment, adrenal insufficiency can be fatal. Pale skin that easily burns when exposed to the sun and red hair are common in POMC deficiency, although not everyone with the condition has these characteristics.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'POMC deficiency is caused by mutations in the POMC gene, which provides instructions for making the proopiomelanocortin protein. This protein is cut cleaved into smaller pieces called peptides that have different functions in the body. One of these peptides, ACTH, stimulates the release of another hormone called cortisol from the adrenal glands. Cortisol is involved in the maintenance of blood sugar levels. Another peptide, alpha melanocyte stimulating hormone MSH , plays a role in the production of the pigment that gives skin and hair their color. The MSH peptide and another peptide called beta melanocyte stimulating hormone MSH act in the brain to help maintain the balance between energy from food taken into the body and energy spent by the body. The correct balance is important to control eating and weight. POMC gene mutations that cause POMC deficiency result in production of an abnormally short version of the POMC protein or no protein at all. As a result, there is a shortage of the peptides made from POMC, including ACTH, MSH, and MSH. Without ACTH, there is a reduction in cortisol production, leading to adrenal insufficiency. Decreased MSH in the skin reduces pigment production, resulting in the red hair and pale skin often seen in people with POMC deficiency. Loss of MSH and MSH in the brain dysregulates the body s energy balance, leading to overeating and severe obesity. POMC deficiency is a rare cause of obesity POMC gene mutations are not frequently associated with more common, complex forms of obesity. Researchers are studying other factors that are likely involved in these forms.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Primary ciliary dyskinesia is a disorder characterized by chronic respiratory tract infections, abnormally positioned internal organs, and the inability to have children infertility . The signs and symptoms of this condition are caused by abnormal cilia and flagella. Cilia are microscopic, finger like projections that stick out from the surface of cells. They are found in the linings of the airway, the reproductive system, and other organs and tissues. Flagella are tail like structures, similar to cilia, that propel sperm cells forward. In the respiratory tract, cilia move back and forth in a coordinated way to move mucus towards the throat. This movement of mucus helps to eliminate fluid, bacteria, and particles from the lungs. Most babies with primary ciliary dyskinesia experience breathing problems at birth, which suggests that cilia play an important role in clearing fetal fluid from the lungs. Beginning in early childhood, affected individuals develop frequent respiratory tract infections. Without properly functioning cilia in the airway, bacteria remain in the respiratory tract and cause infection. People with primary ciliary dyskinesia also have year round nasal congestion and a chronic cough. Chronic respiratory tract infections can result in a condition called bronchiectasis, which damages the passages, called bronchi, leading from the windpipe to the lungs and can cause life threatening breathing problems. Some individuals with primary ciliary dyskinesia have abnormally placed organs within their chest and abdomen. These abnormalities arise early in embryonic development when the differences between the left and right sides of the body are established. About 50 percent of people with primary ciliary dyskinesia have a mirror image reversal of their internal organs situs inversus totalis . For example, in these individuals the heart is on the right side of the body instead of on the left. Situs inversus totalis does not cause any apparent health problems. When someone with primary ciliary dyskinesia has situs inversus totalis, they are often said to have Kartagener syndrome. Approximately 12 percent of people with primary ciliary dyskinesia have a condition known as heterotaxy syndrome or situs ambiguus, which is characterized by abnormalities of the heart, liver, intestines, or spleen. These organs may be structurally abnormal or improperly positioned. In addition, affected individuals may lack a spleen asplenia or have multiple spleens polysplenia . Heterotaxy syndrome results from problems establishing the left and right sides of the body during embryonic development. The severity of heterotaxy varies widely among affected individuals. Primary ciliary dyskinesia can also lead to infertility. Vigorous movements of the flagella are necessary to propel the sperm cells forward to the female egg cell. Because their sperm do not move properly, males with primary ciliary dyskinesia are usually unable to father children. Infertility occurs in some affected females and is likely due to abnormal cilia in the fallopian tubes. Another feature of primary ciliary dyskinesia is recurrent ear infections otitis media , especially in young children. Otitis media can lead to permanent hearing loss if untreated. The ear infections are likely related to abnormal cilia within the inner ear. Rarely, individuals with primary ciliary dyskinesia have an accumulation of fluid in the brain hydrocephalus , likely due to abnormal cilia in the brain.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Primary ciliary dyskinesia can result from mutations in many different genes. These genes provide instructions for making proteins that form the inner structure of cilia and produce the force needed for cilia to bend. Coordinated back and forth movement of cilia is necessary for the normal functioning of many organs and tissues. The movement of cilia also helps establish the left right axis the imaginary line that separates the left and right sides of the body during embryonic development. Mutations in the genes that cause primary ciliary dyskinesia result in defective cilia that move abnormally or are unable to move immotile . Because cilia have many important functions within the body, defects in these cell structures cause a variety of signs and symptoms. Mutations in the DNAI1 and DNAH5 genes account for up to 30 percent of all cases of primary ciliary dyskinesia. Mutations in the other genes associated with this condition are found in only a small percentage of cases. In many people with primary ciliary dyskinesia, the cause of the disorder is unknown.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Pompe disease is an inherited disorder caused by the buildup of a complex sugar called glycogen in the body s cells. The accumulation of glycogen in certain organs and tissues, especially muscles, impairs their ability to function normally. Researchers have described three types of Pompe disease, which differ in severity and the age at which they appear. These types are known as classic infantile onset, non classic infantile onset, and late onset. The classic form of infantile onset Pompe disease begins within a few months of birth. Infants with this disorder typically experience muscle weakness myopathy , poor muscle tone hypotonia , an enlarged liver hepatomegaly , and heart defects. Affected infants may also fail to gain weight and grow at the expected rate failure to thrive and have breathing problems. If untreated, this form of Pompe disease leads to death from heart failure in the first year of life. The non classic form of infantile onset Pompe disease usually appears by age 1. It is characterized by delayed motor skills such as rolling over and sitting and progressive muscle weakness. The heart may be abnormally large cardiomegaly , but affected individuals usually do not experience heart failure. The muscle weakness in this disorder leads to serious breathing problems, and most children with non classic infantile onset Pompe disease live only into early childhood. The late onset type of Pompe disease may not become apparent until later in childhood, adolescence, or adulthood. Late onset Pompe disease is usually milder than the infantile onset forms of this disorder and is less likely to involve the heart. Most individuals with late onset Pompe disease experience progressive muscle weakness, especially in the legs and the trunk, including the muscles that control breathing. As the disorder progresses, breathing problems can lead to respiratory failure.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Capillary malformation arteriovenous malformation syndrome CM AVM is a disorder of the vascular system, which is the body s complex network of blood vessels. The vascular system consists of arteries, which carry oxygen rich blood from the heart to the body s various organs and tissues veins, which carry blood back to the heart and capillaries, which are tiny blood vessels that connect arteries and veins. CM AVM is characterized by capillary malformations CMs , which are composed of enlarged capillaries that increase blood flow near the surface of the skin. These malformations look like multiple small, round, pink or red spots on the skin. In most affected individuals, capillary malformations occur on the face, arms, and legs. These spots may be visible from birth or may develop during childhood. By themselves, capillary malformations usually do not cause any health problems. In some people with CM AVM, capillary malformations are the only sign of the disorder. However, other affected individuals also have more serious vascular abnormalities known as arteriovenous malformations AVMs and arteriovenous fistulas AVFs . AVMs and AVFs are abnormal connections between arteries, veins, and capillaries that affect blood circulation. Depending on where they occur in the body, these abnormalities can be associated with complications including abnormal bleeding, migraine headaches, seizures, and heart failure. In some cases the complications can be life threatening. In people with CM AVM, complications of AVMs and AVFs tend to appear in infancy or early childhood however, some of these vascular abnormalities never cause any symptoms. Some vascular abnormalities seen in CM AVM are similar to those that occur in a condition called Parkes Weber syndrome. In addition to vascular abnormalities, Parkes Weber syndrome usually involves overgrowth of one limb. CM AVM and some cases of Parkes Weber syndrome have the same genetic cause.',\n",

The role of the p120 RasGAP protein is not fully understood, although it appears to be essential for the normal development of the vascular system. Mutations in the RASA1 gene lead to the production of a nonfunctional version of the p120 RasGAP protein. A loss of this protein s activity disrupts tightly regulated chemical signaling during development. However, it is unclear how these changes lead to the specific vascular abnormalities seen in people with CM AVM.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Chediak Higashi syndrome is a condition that affects many parts of the body, particularly the immune system. This disease damages immune system cells, leaving them less able to fight off invaders such as viruses and bacteria. As a result, most people with Chediak Higashi syndrome have repeated and persistent infections starting in infancy or early childhood. These infections tend to be very serious or life threatening. Chediak Higashi syndrome is also characterized by a condition called oculocutaneous albinism, which causes abnormally light coloring pigmentation of the skin, hair, and eyes. Affected individuals typically have fair skin and light colored hair, often with a metallic sheen. Oculocutaneous albinism also causes vision problems such as reduced sharpness rapid, involuntary eye movements nystagmus and increased sensitivity to light photophobia . Many people with Chediak Higashi syndrome have problems with blood clotting coagulation that lead to easy bruising and abnormal bleeding. In adulthood, Chediak Higashi syndrome can also affect the nervous system, causing weakness, clumsiness, difficulty with walking, and seizures. If the disease is not successfully treated, most children with Chediak Higashi syndrome reach a stage of the disorder known as the accelerated phase. This severe phase of the disease is thought to be triggered by a viral infection. In the accelerated phase, white blood cells which normally help fight infection divide uncontrollably and invade many of the body s organs. The accelerated phase is associated with fever, episodes of abnormal bleeding, overwhelming infections, and organ failure. These medical problems are usually life threatening in childhood. A small percentage of people with Chediak Higashi syndrome have a milder form of the condition that appears later in life. People with the adult form of the disorder have less noticeable changes in pigmentation and are less likely to have recurrent, severe infections. They do, however, have a significant risk of progressive neurological problems such as tremors, difficulty with movement and balance ataxia , reduced sensation and weakness in the arms and legs peripheral neuropathy , and a decline in intellectual functioning.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Chediak Higashi syndrome is caused by mutations in the LYST gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein known as the lysosomal trafficking regulator. Researchers believe that this protein plays a role in the transport trafficking of materials into structures called lysosomes and similar cell structures. Lysosomes act as recycling centers within cells. They use digestive enzymes to break down toxic substances, digest bacteria that invade the cell, and recycle worn out cell components. Mutations in the LYST gene impair the normal function of the lysosomal trafficking regulator protein, which disrupts the size, structure, and function of lysosomes and related structures in cells throughout the body. In many cells, the lysosomes are abnormally large and interfere with normal cell functions. For example, enlarged lysosomes in certain immune system cells prevent these cells from responding appropriately to bacteria and other foreign invaders. As a result, the malfunctioning immune system cannot protect the body from infections. In pigment cells called melanocytes, cellular structures called melanosomes which are related to lysosomes are abnormally large. Melanosomes produce and distribute a pigment called melanin, which is the substance that gives skin, hair, and eyes their color. People with Chediak Higashi syndrome have oculocutaneous albinism because melanin is trapped within the giant melanosomes and is unable to contribute to skin, hair, and eye pigmentation. Researchers believe that abnormal lysosome like structures inside blood cells called platelets underlie the abnormal bruising and bleeding seen in people with Chediak Higashi syndrome. Similarly, abnormal lysosomes in nerve cells probably cause the neurological problems associated with this disease.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mabry syndrome is a condition characterized by intellectual disability, distinctive facial features, increased levels of an enzyme called alkaline phosphatase in the blood hyperphosphatasia , and other signs and symptoms. People with Mabry syndrome have intellectual disability that is often moderate to severe. They typically have little to no speech development and are delayed in the development of motor skills such as sitting, crawling, and walking . Many affected individuals have low muscle tone hypotonia and develop recurrent seizures epilepsy in early childhood. Seizures are usually the generalized tonic clonic type, which involve muscle rigidity, convulsions, and loss of consciousness. Individuals with Mabry syndrome have distinctive facial features that include wide set eyes hypertelorism , long openings of the eyelids long palpebral fissures , a nose with a broad bridge and a rounded tip, downturned corners of the mouth, and a thin upper lip. These facial features usually become less pronounced over time. Hyperphosphatasia begins within the first year of life in people with Mabry syndrome. There are many different types of alkaline phosphatase found in tissues the type that is increased in Mabry syndrome is called the tissue non specific type and is found throughout the body. In affected individuals, alkaline phosphatase levels in the blood are usually increased by one to two times the normal amount, but can be up to 20 times higher than normal. The elevated enzyme levels remain relatively stable over a person s lifetime. Hyperphosphatasia appears to cause no negative health effects, but this finding can help health professionals diagnose Mabry syndrome. Another common feature of Mabry syndrome is shortened bones at the ends of fingers brachytelephalangy , which can be seen on x ray imaging. Underdeveloped fingernails nail hypoplasia may also occur. Sometimes, individuals with Mabry syndrome have abnormalities of the digestive system, including narrowing or blockage of the anus anal stenosis or anal atresia or Hirschsprung disease, a disorder that causes severe constipation or blockage of the intestine. Rarely, affected individuals experience hearing loss. The signs and symptoms of Mabry syndrome vary among affected individuals. Those who are least severely affected have only intellectual disability and hyperphosphatasia, without distinctive facial features or the other health problems listed above.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mutations in the PIGV, PIGO, or PGAP2 gene cause Mabry syndrome. These genes are all involved in the production synthesis of a molecule called a glycosylphosphosphatidylinositol GPI anchor. This molecule is synthesized in a series of steps. It then attaches binds to various proteins and binds them to the outer surface of the cell membrane, ensuring that they are available when needed. Alkaline phosphatase is an example of a protein that is bound to the cell membrane by a GPI anchor. The proteins produced from the PIGV and PIGO genes are involved in piecing together the GPI anchor. After the complete GPI anchor is attached to a protein, the protein produced from the PGAP2 gene adjusts the anchor to enhance the anchor s ability to bind to the cell membrane. Mutations in the PIGV, PIGO, or PGAP2 gene result in the production of an incomplete GPI anchor that cannot attach to proteins or to cell membranes. Proteins lacking a functional GPI anchor cannot bind to the cell membrane and are instead released from the cell. The release of non GPI anchored alkaline phosphatase elevates the amount of this protein in the blood, causing hyperphosphatasia in people with Mabry syndrome. It is unclear how gene mutations lead to the other features of Mabry syndrome, but these signs and symptoms are likely due to a lack of proper GPI anchoring of proteins. PIGV gene mutations are the most frequent cause of Mabry syndrome, accounting for approximately half of all cases. Mutations in the PIGO and PGAP2 genes are responsible for a small proportion of Mabry syndrome. The remaining affected individuals do not have an identified mutation in any of these three genes the cause of the condition in these individuals is unknown.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Caudal regression syndrome is a disorder that impairs the development of the lower caudal half of the body. Affected areas can include the lower back and limbs, the genitourinary tract, and the gastrointestinal tract. In this disorder, the bones of the lower spine vertebrae are frequently misshapen or missing, and the corresponding sections of the spinal cord are also irregular or missing. Affected individuals may have incomplete closure of the vertebrae around the spinal cord, a fluid filled sac on the back covered by skin that may or may not contain part of the spinal cord, or tufts of hair at the base of the spine. People with caudal regression syndrome can also have an abnormal side to side curvature of the spine scoliosis . The spinal abnormalities may affect the size and shape of the chest, leading to breathing problems in some individuals. Individuals with caudal regression syndrome may have small hip bones with a limited range of motion. The buttocks tend to be flat and dimpled. The bones of the legs are typically underdeveloped, most frequently the upper leg bones femurs . In some individuals, the legs are bent with the knees pointing out to the side and the feet tucked underneath the hips sometimes called a frog leg like position . Affected individuals may be born with inward and upward turning feet clubfeet , or the feet may be outward and upward turning calcaneovalgus . Some people experience decreased sensation in their lower limbs. Abnormalities in the genitourinary tract in caudal regression syndrome are extremely varied. Often the kidneys are malformed defects include a missing kidney unilateral renal agenesis , kidneys that are fused together horseshoe kidney , or duplication of the tubes that carry urine from each kidney to the bladder ureteral duplication . These kidney abnormalities can lead to frequent urinary tract infections and progressive kidney failure. Additionally, affected individuals may have protrusion of the bladder through an opening in the abdominal wall bladder exstrophy . Damage to the nerves that control bladder function, a condition called neurogenic bladder, causes affected individuals to have progressive difficulty controlling the flow of urine. Genital abnormalities in males can include the urethra opening on the underside of the penis hypospadia or undescended testes cryptorchidism . Females may have an abnormal connection between the rectum and vagina rectovaginal fistula . In severe cases, both males and females have a lack of development of the genitalia genital agenesis . People with caudal regression syndrome may have abnormal twisting malrotation of the large intestine, an obstruction of the anal opening imperforate anus , soft out pouchings in the lower abdomen inguinal hernias , or other malformations of the gastrointestinal tract. Affected individuals are often constipated and may experience loss of control of bladder and bowel function.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Caudal regression syndrome is a complex condition that may have different causes in different people. The condition is likely caused by the interaction of multiple genetic and environmental factors. One risk factor for the development of caudal regression syndrome is the presence of diabetes in the mother. It is thought that increased blood sugar levels and other metabolic problems related to diabetes may have a harmful effect on a developing fetus, increasing the likelihood of developing caudal regression syndrome. The risks to the fetus are further increased if the mother s diabetes is poorly managed. Caudal regression syndrome also occurs in infants of non diabetic mothers, so researchers are trying to identify other factors that contribute to the development of this complex disorder. Some researchers believe that a disruption of fetal development around day 28 of pregnancy causes caudal regression syndrome. The developmental problem is thought to affect the middle layer of embryonic tissue known as the mesoderm. Disruption of normal mesoderm development impairs normal formation of parts of the skeleton, gastrointestinal system, and genitourinary system. Other researchers think that caudal regression syndrome results from the presence of an abnormal artery in the abdomen, which diverts blood flow away from the lower areas of the developing fetus. Decreased blood flow to these areas is thought to interfere with their development and result in the signs and symptoms of caudal regression syndrome. Some scientists believe that the abnormal development of the mesoderm causes the reduction of blood flow, while other scientists believe that the reduction in blood flow causes the abnormal mesoderm development. Many scientists think that the cause of caudal regression syndrome is a combination of abnormal mesoderm development and decreased blood flow to the caudal areas of the fetus.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Friedreich ataxia is a genetic condition that affects the nervous system and causes movement problems. People with this condition develop impaired muscle coordination ataxia that worsens over time. Other features of this condition include the gradual loss of strength and sensation in the arms and legs, muscle stiffness spasticity , and impaired speech. Individuals with Friedreich ataxia often have a form of heart disease called hypertrophic cardiomyopathy that enlarges and weakens the heart muscle. Some affected individuals develop diabetes, impaired vision, hearing loss, or an abnormal curvature of the spine scoliosis . Most people with Friedreich ataxia begin to experience the signs and symptoms of the disorder around puberty. Poor balance when walking and slurred speech are often the first noticeable features. Affected individuals typically require the use of a wheelchair about 10 years after signs and symptoms appear. About 25 percent of people with Friedreich ataxia have an atypical form that begins after age 25. Affected individuals who develop Friedreich ataxia between ages 26 and 39 are considered to have late onset Friedreich ataxia LOFA . When the signs and symptoms begin after age 40 the condition is called very late onset Friedreich ataxia VLOFA . LOFA and VLOFA usually progress more slowly than typical Friedreich ataxia.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mutations in the FXN gene cause Friedreich ataxia. This gene provides instructions for making a protein called frataxin. Although its role is not fully understood, frataxin appears to be important for the normal function of mitochondria, the energy producing centers within cells. One region of the FXN gene contains a segment of DNA known as a GAA trinucleotide repeat. This segment is made up of a series of three DNA building blocks one guanine and two adenines that appear multiple times in a row. Normally, this segment is repeated 5 to 33 times within the FXN gene. In people with Friedreich ataxia, the GAA segment is repeated 66 to more than 1,000 times. The length of the GAA trinucleotide repeat appears to be related to the age at which the symptoms of Friedreich ataxia appear. People with GAA segments repeated fewer than 300 times tend to have a later appearance of symptoms after age 25 than those with larger GAA trinucleotide repeats. The abnormally long GAA trinucleotide repeat disrupts the production of frataxin, which severely reduces the amount of this protein in cells. Certain nerve and muscle cells cannot function properly with a shortage of frataxin, leading to the characteristic signs and symptoms of Friedreich ataxia.',\n",

Signs and symptoms of this disorder can begin a few days after birth or later in childhood. The initial symptoms often include poor feeding, lack of energy lethargy , vomiting, and an irritable mood. These symptoms sometimes progress to serious medical problems such as difficulty breathing, seizures, and coma. Additional problems can include poor growth, vision problems, learning disabilities, muscle weakness, and delays in motor skills such as standing and walking. Symptoms of 2 methylbutyryl CoA dehydrogenase deficiency may be triggered by prolonged periods without food fasting , infections, or eating an increased amount of protein rich foods.

Several types of spasms have been described, but the most commonly reported involves bending at the waist and neck with extension of the arms and legs sometimes called a jackknife spasm . Each spasm lasts only seconds, but they occur in clusters several minutes long. Although individuals are not usually affected while they are sleeping, the spasms commonly occur just after awakening. Infantile spasms usually disappear by age 5, but many children then develop other types of seizures that recur throughout their lives. Most babies with X linked infantile spasm syndrome have characteristic results on an electroencephalogram EEG , a test used to measure the electrical activity of the brain. The EEG of these individuals typically shows an irregular pattern known as hypsarrhythmia, and this finding can help differentiate infantile spasms from other types of seizures. Because of the recurrent seizures, babies with X linked infantile spasm syndrome stop developing normally and begin to lose skills they have acquired developmental regression , such as sitting, rolling over, and babbling. Subsequently, development in affected children is delayed. Most affected individuals also have intellectual disability throughout their lives.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'X linked infantile spasm syndrome is caused by mutations in either the ARX gene or the CDKL5 gene. The proteins produced from these genes play a role in the normal functioning of the brain. The ARX protein is involved in the regulation of other genes that contribute to brain development. The CDKL5 protein is thought to regulate the activity of at least one protein that is critical for normal brain function. Researchers are working to determine how mutations in either of these genes lead to seizures and intellectual disability. Infantile spasms can have nongenetic causes, such as brain malformations, other disorders that affect brain function, or brain damage. In addition, changes in genes that are not located on the X chromosome cause infantile spasms in rare cases.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'X linked infantile spasm syndrome can have different inheritance patterns depending on the genetic cause. When caused by mutations in the ARX gene, this condition is inherited in an X linked recessive pattern. The ARX gene is located on the X chromosome, which is one of the two sex chromosomes. In males who have only one X chromosome , one altered copy of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. Usually in females who have two X chromosomes , a mutation would have to occur in both copies of the gene to cause the disorder. However, in some instances, one altered copy of the ARX gene is sufficient because the X chromosome with the normal copy of the ARX gene is turned off through a process called X inactivation. Early in embryonic development in females, one of the two X chromosomes is permanently inactivated in somatic cells cells other than egg and sperm cells . X inactivation ensures that females, like males, have only one active copy of the X chromosome in each body cell. Usually X inactivation occurs randomly, such that each X chromosome is active in about half of the body cells. Sometimes X inactivation is not random, and one X chromosome is active in more than half of cells. When X inactivation does not occur randomly, it is called skewed X inactivation. Some ARX gene mutations may be associated with skewed X inactivation, which results in the inactivation of the X chromosome with the normal copy of the ARX gene in most cells of the body. This skewed X inactivation causes the chromosome with the mutated ARX gene to be expressed in more than half of cells, causing X linked infantile spasm syndrome. When caused by mutations in the CDKL5 gene, this condition is thought to have an X linked dominant inheritance pattern. The CDKL5 gene is also located on the X chromosome, making this condition X linked. The inheritance is dominant because one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition in both males and females. X linked infantile spasm syndrome caused by CDKL5 gene mutations usually occurs in individuals with no history of the disorder in their family. These mutations likely occur in early embryonic development called de novo mutations . Because males have only one X chromosome, X linked dominant disorders are often more severe in males than in females. Male fetuses with CDKL5 related X linked infantile spasm syndrome may not survive to birth, so more females are diagnosed with the condition. In females, the distribution of active and inactive X chromosomes due to X inactivation may affect whether a woman develops the condition or the severity of the signs and symptoms. Generally, the larger the proportion of active X chromosomes that contain the mutated CDKL5 gene, the more severe the signs and symptoms of the condition are. A characteristic of X linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass X linked traits to their sons.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Wolff Parkinson White syndrome is a condition characterized by abnormal electrical pathways in the heart that cause a disruption of the heart s normal rhythm arrhythmia . The heartbeat is controlled by electrical signals that move through the heart in a highly coordinated way. A specialized cluster of cells called the atrioventricular node conducts electrical impulses from the heart s upper chambers the atria to the lower chambers the ventricles . Impulses move through the atrioventricular node during each heartbeat, stimulating the ventricles to contract slightly later than the atria. People with Wolff Parkinson White syndrome are born with an extra connection in the heart, called an accessory pathway, that allows electrical signals to bypass the atrioventricular node and move from the atria to the ventricles faster than usual. The accessory pathway may also transmit electrical impulses abnormally from the ventricles back to the atria. This extra connection can disrupt the coordinated movement of electrical signals through the heart, leading to an abnormally fast heartbeat tachycardia and other arrhythmias. Resulting symptoms include dizziness, a sensation of fluttering or pounding in the chest palpitations , shortness of breath, and fainting syncope . In rare cases, arrhythmias associated with Wolff Parkinson White syndrome can lead to cardiac arrest and sudden death. The most common arrhythmia associated with Wolff Parkinson White syndrome is called paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. Complications of Wolff Parkinson White syndrome can occur at any age, although some individuals born with an accessory pathway in the heart never experience any health problems associated with the condition. Wolff Parkinson White syndrome often occurs with other structural abnormalities of the heart or underlying heart disease. The most common heart defect associated with the condition is Ebstein anomaly, which affects the valve that allows blood to flow from the right atrium to the right ventricle the tricuspid valve . Additionally, Wolff Parkinson White syndrome can be a component of several other genetic syndromes, including hypokalemic periodic paralysis a condition that causes episodes of extreme muscle weakness , Pompe disease a disorder characterized by the storage of excess glycogen , and tuberous sclerosis a condition that results in the growth of noncancerous tumors in many parts of the body .',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mutations in the PRKAG2 gene cause Wolff Parkinson White syndrome. A small percentage of all cases of Wolff Parkinson White syndrome are caused by mutations in the PRKAG2 gene. Some people with these mutations also have features of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a form of heart disease that enlarges and weakens the heart cardiac muscle. The PRKAG2 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is part of an enzyme called AMP activated protein kinase AMPK . This enzyme helps sense and respond to energy demands within cells. It is likely involved in the development of the heart before birth, although its role in this process is unknown. Researchers are uncertain how PRKAG2 mutations lead to the development of Wolff Parkinson White syndrome and related heart abnormalities. Research suggests that these mutations alter the activity of AMP activated protein kinase in the heart, although it is unclear whether the genetic changes overactivate the enzyme or reduce its activity. Studies indicate that changes in AMP activated protein kinase activity allow a complex sugar called glycogen to build up abnormally within cardiac muscle cells. Other studies have found that altered AMP activated protein kinase activity is related to changes in the regulation of certain ion channels in the heart. These channels, which transport positively charged atoms ions into and out of cardiac muscle cells, play critical roles in maintaining the heart s normal rhythm. In most cases, the cause of Wolff Parkinson White syndrome is unknown.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Zellweger spectrum disorder is a group of conditions that have overlapping signs and symptoms and affect many parts of the body. This group of conditions includes Zellweger syndrome, neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy NALD , and infantile Refsum disease. These conditions were once thought to be distinct disorders but are now considered to be part of the same condition spectrum. Zellweger syndrome is the most severe form of the Zellweger spectrum disorder, NALD is intermediate in severity, and infantile Refsum disease is the least severe form. Because these three conditions are now considered one disorder, some researchers prefer not to use the separate condition names but to instead refer to cases as severe, intermediate, or mild. Individuals with Zellweger syndrome, at the severe end of the spectrum, develop signs and symptoms of the condition during the newborn period. These infants experience weak muscle tone hypotonia , feeding problems, hearing and vision loss, and seizures. These problems are caused by the breakdown of myelin, which is the covering that protects nerves and promotes the efficient transmission of nerve impulses. The part of the brain and spinal cord that contains myelin is called white matter. Destruction of myelin demyelination leads to loss of white matter leukodystrophy . Children with Zellweger syndrome also develop life threatening problems in other organs and tissues, such as the liver, heart, and kidneys. They may have skeletal abnormalities, including a large space between the bones of the skull fontanels and characteristic bone spots known as chondrodysplasia punctata that can be seen on x ray. Affected individuals have distinctive facial features, including a flattened face, broad nasal bridge, and high forehead. Children with Zellweger syndrome typically do not survive beyond the first year of life. People with NALD or infantile Refsum disease, which are at the less severe end of the spectrum, have more variable features than those with Zellweger syndrome and usually do not develop signs and symptoms of the disease until late infancy or early childhood. They may have many of the features of Zellweger syndrome however, their condition typically progresses more slowly. Children with these less severe conditions often have hypotonia, vision problems, hearing loss, liver dysfunction, developmental delay, and some degree of intellectual disability. Most people with NALD survive into childhood, and those with infantile Refsum disease may reach adulthood. In rare cases, individuals at the mildest end of the condition spectrum have developmental delay in childhood and hearing loss or vision problems beginning in adulthood and do not develop the other features of this disorder.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mutations in at least 12 genes have been found to cause Zellweger spectrum disorder. These genes provide instructions for making a group of proteins known as peroxins, which are essential for the formation and normal functioning of cell structures called peroxisomes. Peroxisomes are sac like compartments that contain enzymes needed to break down many different substances, including fatty acids and certain toxic compounds. They are also important for the production of fats lipids used in digestion and in the nervous system. Peroxins assist in the formation biogenesis of peroxisomes by producing the membrane that separates the peroxisome from the rest of the cell and by importing enzymes into the peroxisome. Mutations in the genes that cause Zellweger spectrum disorder prevent peroxisomes from forming normally. Diseases that disrupt the formation of peroxisomes, including Zellweger spectrum disorder, are called peroxisome biogenesis disorders. If the production of peroxisomes is altered, these structures cannot perform their usual functions. The signs and symptoms of Zellweger syndrome are due to the absence of functional peroxisomes within cells. NALD and infantile Refsum disease are caused by mutations that allow some peroxisomes to form. Mutations in the PEX1 gene are the most common cause of Zellweger spectrum disorder and are found in nearly 70 percent of affected individuals. The other genes associated with Zellweger spectrum disorder each account for a smaller percentage of cases of this condition.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Fish eye disease is caused by mutations in the LCAT gene. This gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase LCAT . The LCAT enzyme plays a role in removing cholesterol from the blood and tissues by helping it attach to molecules called lipoproteins, which carry it to the liver. Once in the liver, the cholesterol is redistributed to other tissues or removed from the body. The enzyme has two major functions, called alpha and beta LCAT activity. Alpha LCAT activity helps attach cholesterol to a lipoprotein called high density lipoprotein HDL . Beta LCAT activity helps attach cholesterol to other lipoproteins called very low density lipoprotein VLDL and low density lipoprotein LDL . LCAT gene mutations that cause fish eye disease impair alpha LCAT activity, reducing the enzyme s ability to attach cholesterol to HDL. Impairment of this mechanism for reducing cholesterol in the body leads to cholesterol containing opacities in the corneas. It is not known why the cholesterol deposits affect only the corneas in this disorder. Mutations that affect both alpha LCAT activity and beta LCAT activity lead to a related disorder called complete LCAT deficiency, which involves corneal opacities in combination with features affecting other parts of the body.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Familial paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia is a disorder characterized by episodes of abnormal movement that range from mild to severe. In the condition name, the word paroxysmal indicates that the abnormal movements come and go over time, kinesigenic means that episodes are triggered by movement, and dyskinesia refers to involuntary movement of the body. People with familial paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia experience episodes of irregular jerking or shaking movements that are induced by sudden motion, such as standing up quickly or being startled. An episode may involve slow, prolonged muscle contractions dystonia small, fast, dance like motions chorea writhing movements of the limbs athetosis or, rarely, flailing movements of the limbs ballismus . Familial paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia may affect one or both sides of the body. The type of abnormal movement varies among affected individuals, even among members of the same family. In many people with familial paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia, a pattern of symptoms called an aura immediately precedes the episode. The aura is often described as a crawling or tingling sensation in the affected body part. Individuals with this condition do not lose consciousness during an episode and do not experience any symptoms between episodes. Individuals with familial paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia usually begin to show signs and symptoms of the disorder during childhood or adolescence. Episodes typically last less than five minutes, and the frequency of episodes ranges from one per month to 100 per day. In most affected individuals, episodes occur less often with age. In some people with familial paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia the disorder begins in infancy with recurring seizures called benign infantile convulsions. These seizures usually develop in the first year of life and stop by age 3. When benign infantile convulsions are associated with familial paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia, the condition is known as infantile convulsions and choreoathetosis ICCA . In families with ICCA, some individuals develop only benign infantile convulsions, some have only familial paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia, and others develop both.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Giant axonal neuropathy is an inherited condition involving dysfunction of a specific type of protein in nerve cells neurons . The protein is essential for normal nerve function because it forms neurofilaments. Neurofilaments make up a structural framework that helps to define the shape and size of the neurons. This condition is characterized by abnormally large and dysfunctional axons, which are the specialized extensions of nerve cells that are required for the transmission of nerve impulses. Giant axonal neuropathy generally appears in infancy or early childhood. It progresses slowly as neuronal injury becomes more severe. Signs of giant axonal neuropathy usually begin in the peripheral nervous system, which governs movement and sensation in the arms, legs, and other parts of the body. Most individuals with this disorder first have problems with walking. Later they may lose sensation, coordination, strength, and reflexes in their limbs. Hearing and visual problems may also occur. Extremely kinky hair as compared to others in the family is characteristic of giant axonal neuropathy, occurring in almost all affected people. As the disorder progresses, the brain and spinal cord central nervous system may become involved, causing a gradual decline in mental function, loss of control of body movement, and seizures.',\n",

Some GAN gene mutations change the shape of the protein, affecting how it binds to other proteins to form a functional complex. Other mutations prevent cells from producing any gigaxonin protein. Gigaxonin is involved in a cellular function that destroys and gets rid of excess or damaged proteins using a mechanism called the ubiquitin proteasome system. Neurons without functional gigaxonin accumulate excess neurofilaments in the axon, causing the axons to become distended. These giant axons do not transmit signals properly and eventually deteriorate, resulting in problems with movement and other nervous system dysfunction.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Familial osteochondritis dissecans is a condition that affects the joints and is associated with abnormal cartilage. Cartilage is a tough but flexible tissue that covers the ends of the bones at joints and is also part of the developing skeleton. A characteristic feature of familial osteochondritis dissecans is areas of bone damage lesions caused by detachment of cartilage and a piece of the underlying bone from the end of the bone at a joint. People with this condition develop multiple lesions that affect several joints, primarily the knees, elbows, hips, and ankles. The lesions cause stiffness, pain, and swelling in the joint. Often, the affected joint feels like it catches or locks during movement. Other characteristic features of familial osteochondritis dissecans include short stature and development of a joint disorder called osteoarthritis at an early age. Osteoarthritis is characterized by the breakdown of joint cartilage and the underlying bone. It causes pain and stiffness and restricts the movement of joints. A similar condition called sporadic osteochondritis dissecans is associated with a single lesion in one joint, most often the knee. These cases may be caused by injury to or repetitive use of the joint often sports related . Some people with sporadic osteochondritis dissecans develop osteoarthritis in the affected joint, especially if the lesion occurs later in life after the bone has stopped growing.

       "  'answer': 'Mutation of the ACAN gene can cause familial osteochondritis dissecans. The ACAN gene provides instructions for making the aggrecan protein, which is a component of cartilage. Aggrecan attaches to the other components of cartilage, organizing the network of molecules that gives cartilage its strength. In addition, aggrecan attracts water molecules and gives cartilage its gel like structure. This feature enables the cartilage to resist compression, protecting bones and joints. The ACAN gene mutation associated with familial osteochondritis dissecans results in an abnormal protein that is unable to attach to the other components of cartilage. As a result, the cartilage is disorganized and weak. It is unclear how the abnormal cartilage leads to the lesions and osteoarthritis characteristic of familial osteochondritis dissecans. Researchers suggest that a disorganized cartilage network in growing bones impairs their normal growth, leading to short stature. Sporadic osteochondritis dissecans is not caused by genetic changes and is not inherited.',\n",

Signs and symptoms of the condition become apparent in early childhood. In affected individuals, the long bones in the arms and legs are unusually dense and wide. The bone changes specifically affect the shafts of the long bones, called diaphyses, and areas near the ends of the bones called metaphyses. The bone abnormalities can lead to bowing of the legs and difficulty walking. Ghosal hematodiaphyseal dysplasia also causes scarring fibrosis of the bone marrow, which is the spongy tissue inside long bones where blood cells are formed. The abnormal bone marrow cannot produce enough red blood cells, which leads to anemia.Signs and symptoms of anemia that have been reported in people with Ghosal hematodiaphyseal dysplasia include extremely pale skin pallor and excessive tiredness fatigue .',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Ghosal hematodiaphyseal dysplasia results from mutations in the TBXAS1 gene. This gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called thromboxane A synthase 1, which acts as part of a chemical signaling pathway involved in normal blood clotting hemostasis . Based on its role in Ghosal hematodiaphyseal dysplasia, researchers suspect that thromboxane A synthase 1 may also be important for bone remodeling, which is a normal process in which old bone is removed and new bone is created to replace it, and for the production of red blood cells in bone marrow. Mutations in the TBXAS1 gene severely reduce the activity of thromboxane A synthase 1. Studies suggest that a lack of this enzyme s activity may lead to abnormal bone remodeling and fibrosis of the bone marrow. However, the mechanism by which a shortage of thromboxane A synthase 1 activity leads to the particular abnormalities characteristic of Ghosal hematodiaphyseal dysplasia is unclear.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mutations in the ITGA2B or ITGB3 gene cause Glanzmann thrombasthenia. These genes provide instructions for making the two parts subunits of a receptor protein called integrin alphaIIb beta3 IIb3 . This protein is abundant on the surface of platelets. Platelets are small cell fragments that circulate in blood and are an essential component of blood clots. During clot formation, integrin IIb3 helps platelets bind together. Blood clots protect the body after injury by sealing off damaged blood vessels and preventing further blood loss. ITGA2B or ITGB3 gene mutations result in a shortage deficiency of functional integrin IIb3. As a result, platelets cannot clump together to form a blood clot, leading to prolonged bleeding. Three types of Glanzmann thrombasthenia have been classified according to the amount of integrin IIb3 that is available. People with type I the most common type have less than 5 percent of normal integrin IIb3 levels, people with type II have between 5 and 20 percent of normal integrin IIb3 levels, and people with the variant type have adequate integrin IIb3 levels but produce only nonfunctional integrin.

Individuals with fibronectin glomerulopathy usually have blood and excess protein in their urine hematuria and proteinuria, respectively . They also have high blood pressure hypertension . Some affected individuals develop renal tubular acidosis, which occurs when the kidneys are unable to remove enough acid from the body and the blood becomes too acidic. The kidneys of people with fibronectin glomerulopathy have large deposits of the protein fibronectin 1 in structures called glomeruli. These structures are clusters of tiny blood vessels in the kidneys that filter waste products from blood. The waste products are then released in urine. The fibronectin 1 deposits impair the glomeruli s filtration ability. Fifteen to 20 years following the appearance of signs and symptoms, individuals with fibronectin glomerulopathy often develop end stage renal disease. Affected individuals may receive treatment in the form of a kidney transplant in some cases, fibronectin glomerulopathy comes back recurs following transplantation.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Fibronectin glomerulopathy can be caused by mutations in the FN1 gene. The FN1 gene provides instructions for making the fibronectin 1 protein. Fibronectin 1 is involved in the continual formation of the extracellular matrix, which is an intricate lattice of proteins and other molecules that forms in the spaces between cells. During extracellular matrix formation, fibronectin 1 helps individual cells expand spread and move migrate to cover more space, and it also influences cell shape and maturation differentiation . FN1 gene mutations lead to production of an abnormal fibronectin 1 protein that gets deposited in the glomeruli of the kidneys, probably as the body attempts to filter it out as waste. Even though there is an abundance of fibronectin 1 in the glomeruli, the extracellular matrix that supports the blood vessels is weak because the altered fibronectin 1 cannot assist in the matrix s continual formation. Without a strong cellular support network, the glomeruli are less able to filter waste. As a result, products that normally are retained by the body, such as protein and blood, get released in the urine, and acids are not properly filtered from the blood. Over time, the kidneys ability to filter waste decreases until the kidneys can no longer function, resulting in end stage renal disease. It is estimated that mutations in the FN1 gene are responsible for 40 percent of cases of fibronectin glomerulopathy. The cause of the remaining cases of this condition is unknown.',\n",

ZAP70 related SCID is one of several forms of severe combined immunodeficiency, a group of disorders with several genetic causes. Children with SCID lack virtually all immune protection from bacteria, viruses, and fungi. They are prone to repeated and persistent infections that can be very serious or life threatening. Often the organisms that cause infection in people with this disorder are described as opportunistic because they ordinarily do not cause illness in healthy people. Infants with SCID typically experience pneumonia, chronic diarrhea, and widespread skin rashes. They also grow much more slowly than healthy children. If not treated in a way that restores immune function, children with SCID usually live only a year or two. Most individuals with ZAP70 related SCID are diagnosed in the first 6 months of life.

       "  'answer': 'As the name indicates, this condition is caused by mutations in the ZAP70 gene. The ZAP70 gene provides instructions for making a protein called zeta chain associated protein kinase. This protein is part of a signaling pathway that directs the development of and turns on activates immune system cells called T cells. T cells identify foreign substances and defend the body against infection. The ZAP70 gene is important for the development and function of several types of T cells. These include cytotoxic T cells CD8 T cells , whose functions include destroying cells infected by viruses. The ZAP70 gene is also involved in the activation of helper T cells CD4 T cells . These cells direct and assist the functions of the immune system by influencing the activities of other immune system cells. Mutations in the ZAP70 gene prevent the production of zeta chain associated protein kinase or result in a protein that is unstable and cannot perform its function. A loss of functional zeta chain associated protein kinase leads to the absence of CD8 T cells and an excess of inactive CD4 T cells. The resulting shortage of active T cells causes people with ZAP70 related SCID to be more susceptible to infection.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Wolf Hirschhorn syndrome is a condition that affects many parts of the body. The major features of this disorder include a characteristic facial appearance, delayed growth and development, intellectual disability, and seizures. Almost everyone with this disorder has distinctive facial features, including a broad, flat nasal bridge and a high forehead. This combination is described as a Greek warrior helmet appearance. The eyes are widely spaced and may be protruding. Other characteristic facial features include a shortened distance between the nose and upper lip a short philtrum , a downturned mouth, a small chin micrognathia , and poorly formed ears with small holes pits or flaps of skin tags . Additionally, affected individuals may have asymmetrical facial features and an unusually small head microcephaly . People with Wolf Hirschhorn syndrome experience delayed growth and development. Slow growth begins before birth, and affected infants tend to have problems feeding and gaining weight failure to thrive . They also have weak muscle tone hypotonia and underdeveloped muscles. Motor skills such as sitting, standing, and walking are significantly delayed. Most children and adults with this disorder also have short stature. Intellectual disability ranges from mild to severe in people with Wolf Hirschhorn syndrome. Compared to people with other forms of intellectual disability, their socialization skills are strong, while verbal communication and language skills tend to be weaker. Most affected children also have seizures, which may be resistant to treatment. Seizures tend to disappear with age. Additional features of Wolf Hirschhorn syndrome include skin changes such as mottled or dry skin, skeletal abnormalities such as abnormal curvature of the spine scoliosis and kyphosis , dental problems including missing teeth, and an opening in the roof of the mouth cleft palate and or in the lip cleft lip . Wolf Hirschhorn syndrome can also cause abnormalities of the eyes, heart, genitourinary tract, and brain. A condition called Pitt Rogers Danks syndrome has features that overlap with those of Wolf Hirschhorn syndrome. Researchers now recognize that these two conditions are actually part of a single syndrome with variable signs and symptoms.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Wolf Hirschhorn syndrome is caused by a deletion of genetic material near the end of the short p arm of chromosome 4. This chromosomal change is sometimes written as 4p . The size of the deletion varies among affected individuals studies suggest that larger deletions tend to result in more severe intellectual disability and physical abnormalities than smaller deletions. The signs and symptoms of Wolf Hirschhorn are related to the loss of multiple genes on the short arm of chromosome 4. WHSC1, LETM1, and MSX1 are the genes that are deleted in people with the typical signs and symptoms of this disorder. These genes play significant roles in early development, although many of their specific functions are unknown. Researchers believe that loss of the WHSC1 gene is associated with many of the characteristic features of Wolf Hirschhorn syndrome, including the distinctive facial appearance and developmental delay. Deletion of the LETM1 gene appears to be associated with seizures or other abnormal electrical activity in the brain. A loss of the MSX1 gene may be responsible for the dental abnormalities and cleft lip and or palate that are often seen with this condition. Scientists are working to identify additional genes at the end of the short arm of chromosome 4 that contribute to the characteristic features of Wolf Hirschhorn syndrome.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Between 85 and 90 percent of all cases of Wolf Hirschhorn syndrome are not inherited. They result from a chromosomal deletion that occurs as a random de novo event during the formation of reproductive cells eggs or sperm or in early embryonic development. More complex chromosomal rearrangements can also occur as de novo events, which may help explain the variability in the condition s signs and symptoms. De novo chromosomal changes occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. A small percentage of all people with Wolf Hirschhorn syndrome have the disorder as a result of an unusual chromosomal abnormality such as a ring chromosome 4. Ring chromosomes occur when a chromosome breaks in two places and the ends of the chromosome arms fuse together to form a circular structure. In the process, genes near the ends of the chromosome are lost. In the remaining cases of Wolf Hirschhorn syndrome, an affected individual inherits a copy of chromosome 4 with a deleted segment. In these cases, one of the individual s parents carries a chromosomal rearrangement between chromosome 4 and another chromosome. This rearrangement is called a balanced translocation. No genetic material is gained or lost in a balanced translocation, so these chromosomal changes usually do not cause any health problems. However, translocations can become unbalanced as they are passed to the next generation. Some people with Wolf Hirschhorn syndrome inherit an unbalanced translocation that deletes genes near the end of the short arm of chromosome 4. A loss of these genes results in the intellectual disability, slow growth, and other health problems characteristic of this disorder.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mutations in the LBR gene cause Greenberg dysplasia. This gene provides instructions for making a protein called the lamin B receptor. One region of this protein, called the sterol reductase domain, plays an important role in the production synthesis of cholesterol. Cholesterol is a type of fat that is produced in the body and obtained from foods that come from animals eggs, meat, fish, and dairy products. Cholesterol is necessary for normal embryonic development and has important functions both before and after birth. Cholesterol is an important component of cell membranes and the protective substance covering nerve cells myelin . Additionally, cholesterol plays a role in the production of certain hormones and digestive acids. During cholesterol synthesis, the sterol reductase function of the lamin B receptor allows the protein to perform one of several steps that convert a molecule called lanosterol to cholesterol. LBR gene mutations involved in Greenberg dysplasia lead to loss of the sterol reductase function of the lamin B receptor, and research suggests that this loss causes the condition. Absence of the sterol reductase function disrupts the normal synthesis of cholesterol within cells. This absence may also allow potentially toxic byproducts of cholesterol synthesis to build up in the body s tissues. Researchers suspect that low cholesterol levels or an accumulation of other substances disrupts the growth and development of many parts of the body. It is not known, however, how a disturbance of cholesterol synthesis leads to the specific features of Greenberg dysplasia.',\n",

       "  'answer': '21 hydroxylase deficiency is an inherited disorder that affects the adrenal glands. The adrenal glands are located on top of the kidneys and produce a variety of hormones that regulate many essential functions in the body. In people with 21 hydroxylase deficiency, the adrenal glands produce excess androgens, which are male sex hormones. There are three types of 21 hydroxylase deficiency. Two types are classic forms, known as the salt wasting and simple virilizing types. The third type is called the non classic type. The salt wasting type is the most severe, the simple virilizing type is less severe, and the non classic type is the least severe form. Males and females with either classic form of 21 hydroxylase deficiency tend to have an early growth spurt, but their final adult height is usually shorter than others in their family. Additionally, affected individuals may have a reduced ability to have biological children decreased fertility . Females may also develop excessive body hair growth hirsutism , male pattern baldness, and irregular menstruation. Approximately 75 percent of individuals with classic 21 hydroxylase deficiency have the salt wasting type. Hormone production is extremely low in this form of the disorder. Affected individuals lose large amounts of sodium in their urine, which can be life threatening in early infancy. Babies with the salt wasting type can experience poor feeding, weight loss, dehydration, and vomiting. Individuals with the simple virilizing form do not experience salt loss. In both the salt wasting and simple virilizing forms of this disorder, females typically have external genitalia that do not look clearly male or female ambiguous genitalia . Males usually have normal genitalia, but the testes may be small. Females with the non classic type of 21 hydroxylase deficiency have normal female genitalia. As affected females get older, they may experience hirsutism, male pattern baldness, irregular menstruation, and decreased fertility. Males with the non classic type may have early beard growth and small testes. Some individuals with this type of 21 hydroxylase deficiency have no symptoms of the disorder.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mutations in the CYP21A2 gene cause 21 hydroxylase deficiency. The CYP21A2 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called 21 hydroxylase. This enzyme is found in the adrenal glands, where it plays a role in producing hormones called cortisol and aldosterone. Cortisol has numerous functions, such as maintaining blood sugar levels, protecting the body from stress, and suppressing inflammation. Aldosterone is sometimes called the salt retaining hormone because it regulates the amount of salt retained by the kidneys. The retention of salt affects fluid levels in the body and blood pressure. 21 hydroxylase deficiency is caused by a shortage deficiency of the 21 hydroxylase enzyme. When 21 hydroxylase is lacking, substances that are usually used to form cortisol and aldosterone instead build up in the adrenal glands and are converted to androgens. The excess production of androgens leads to abnormalities of sexual development in people with 21 hydroxylase deficiency. A lack of aldosterone production contributes to the salt loss in people with the salt wasting form of this condition. The amount of functional 21 hydroxylase enzyme determines the severity of the disorder. Individuals with the salt wasting type have CYP21A2 mutations that result in a completely nonfunctional enzyme. People with the simple virilizing type of this condition have CYP21A2 gene mutations that allow the production of low levels of functional enzyme. Individuals with the non classic type of this disorder have CYP21A2 mutations that result in the production of reduced amounts of the enzyme, but more enzyme than either of the other types.',\n",

       "  'answer': '48,XXYY syndrome is a chromosomal condition that causes medical and behavioral problems in males. 48,XXYY disrupts male sexual development. Adolescent and adult males with this condition typically have small testes that do not produce enough testosterone, which is the hormone that directs male sexual development. A shortage of testosterone during puberty can lead to reduced facial and body hair, poor muscle development, low energy levels, and an increased risk for breast enlargement gynecomastia . Because their testes do not function normally, males with 48, XXYY syndrome have an inability to father children infertility . 48,XXYY syndrome can affect other parts of the body as well. Males with 48,XXYY syndrome are often taller than other males their age. They tend to develop a tremor that typically starts in adolescence and worsens with age. Dental problems are frequently seen with this condition they include delayed appearance of the primary baby or secondary adult teeth, thin tooth enamel, crowded and or misaligned teeth, and multiple cavities. As affected males get older, they may develop a narrowing of the blood vessels in the legs, called peripheral vascular disease. Peripheral vascular disease can cause skin ulcers to form. Affected males are also at risk for developing a type of clot called a deep vein thrombosis DVT that occurs in the deep veins of the legs. Additionally, males with 48,XXYY syndrome may have flat feet pes planus , elbow abnormalities, allergies, asthma, type 2 diabetes, seizures, and congenital heart defects. Most males with 48,XXYY syndrome have some degree of difficulty with speech and language development. Learning disabilities, especially reading problems, are very common in males with this disorder. Affected males seem to perform better at tasks focused on math, visual spatial skills such as puzzles, and memorization of locations or directions. Some boys with 48,XXYY syndrome have delayed development of motor skills such as sitting, standing, and walking that can lead to poor coordination. Affected males have higher than average rates of behavioral disorders, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ADHD mood disorders, including anxiety and bipolar disorder and or autism spectrum disorders, which affect communication and social interaction.',\n",

       "  'answer': '48,XXYY syndrome is a condition related to the X and Y chromosomes the sex chromosomes . People normally have 46 chromosomes in each cell. Two of the 46 chromosomes, known as X and Y, are called sex chromosomes because they help determine whether a person will develop male or female sex characteristics. Females typically have two X chromosomes 46,XX , and males have one X chromosome and one Y chromosome 46,XY . 48,XXYY syndrome results from the presence of an extra copy of both sex chromosomes in each of a male s cells 48,XXYY . Extra copies of genes on the X chromosome interfere with male sexual development, preventing the testes from functioning normally and reducing the levels of testosterone. Many genes are found only on the X or Y chromosome, but genes in areas known as the pseudoautosomal regions are present on both sex chromosomes. Extra copies of genes from the pseudoautosomal regions of the extra X and Y chromosome contribute to the signs and symptoms of 48,XXYY syndrome however, the specific genes have not been identified.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'This condition is not inherited it usually occurs as a random event during the formation of reproductive cells eggs and sperm . An error in cell division called nondisjunction results in a reproductive cell with an abnormal number of chromosomes. In 48,XXYY syndrome, the extra sex chromosomes almost always come from a sperm cell. Nondisjunction may cause a sperm cell to gain two extra sex chromosomes, resulting in a sperm cell with three sex chromosomes one X and two Y chromosomes . If that sperm cell fertilizes a normal egg cell with one X chromosome, the resulting child will have two X chromosomes and two Y chromosomes in each of the body s cells. In a small percentage of cases, 48,XXYY syndrome results from nondisjunction of the sex chromosomes in a 46,XY embryo very soon after fertilization has occurred. This means that an normal sperm cell with one Y chromosome fertilized a normal egg cell with one X chromosome, but right after fertilization nondisjunction of the sex chromosomes caused the embryo to gain two extra sex chromosomes, resulting in a 48,XXYY embryo.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Frontometaphyseal dysplasia is a disorder involving abnormalities in skeletal development and other health problems. It is a member of a group of related conditions called otopalatodigital spectrum disorders, which also includes otopalatodigital syndrome type 1, otopalatodigital syndrome type 2, and Melnick Needles syndrome. In general, these disorders involve hearing loss caused by malformations in the tiny bones in the ears ossicles , problems in the development of the roof of the mouth palate , and skeletal abnormalities involving the fingers and or toes digits . Frontometaphyseal dysplasia is distinguished from the other otopalatodigital spectrum disorders by the presence of joint deformities called contractures that restrict the movement of certain joints. People with frontometaphyseal dysplasia may also have bowed limbs, an abnormal curvature of the spine scoliosis , and abnormalities of the fingers and hands. Characteristic facial features may include prominent brow ridges wide set and downward slanting eyes a very small lower jaw and chin micrognathia and small, missing or misaligned teeth. Some affected individuals have hearing loss. In addition to skeletal abnormalities, individuals with frontometaphyseal dysplasia may have obstruction of the ducts between the kidneys and bladder ureters , heart defects, or constrictions in the passages leading from the windpipe to the lungs the bronchi that can cause problems with breathing. Males with frontometaphyseal dysplasia generally have more severe signs and symptoms of the disorder than do females, who may show only the characteristic facial features.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mutations in the FLNA gene cause frontometaphyseal dysplasia. The FLNA gene provides instructions for producing the protein filamin A, which helps build the network of protein filaments cytoskeleton that gives structure to cells and allows them to change shape and move. Filamin A binds to another protein called actin, and helps the actin to form the branching network of filaments that make up the cytoskeleton. Filamin A also links actin to many other proteins to perform various functions within the cell. A small number of mutations in the FLNA gene have been identified in people with frontometaphyseal dysplasia. These mutations are described as gain of function because they appear to enhance the activity of the filamin A protein or give the protein a new, atypical function. Researchers believe that the mutations may change the way the filamin A protein helps regulate processes involved in skeletal development, but it is not known how changes in the protein relate to the specific signs and symptoms of frontometaphyseal dysplasia.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Lowe syndrome is a condition that primarily affects the eyes, brain, and kidneys. This disorder occurs almost exclusively in males. Infants with Lowe syndrome are born with thick clouding of the lenses in both eyes congenital cataracts , often with other eye abnormalities that can impair vision. About half of affected infants develop an eye disease called infantile glaucoma, which is characterized by increased pressure within the eyes. Many individuals with Lowe syndrome have delayed development, and intellectual ability ranges from normal to severely impaired. Behavioral problems and seizures have also been reported in children with this condition. Most affected children have weak muscle tone from birth neonatal hypotonia , which can contribute to feeding difficulties, problems with breathing, and delayed development of motor skills such as sitting, standing, and walking. Kidney renal abnormalities, most commonly a condition known as renal Fanconi syndrome, frequently develop in individuals with Lowe syndrome. The kidneys play an essential role in maintaining the right amounts of minerals, salts, water, and other substances in the body. In individuals with renal Fanconi syndrome, the kidneys are unable to reabsorb important nutrients into the bloodstream. Instead, the nutrients are excreted in the urine. These kidney problems lead to increased urination, dehydration, and abnormally acidic blood metabolic acidosis . A loss of salts and nutrients may also impair growth and result in soft, bowed bones hypophosphatemic rickets , especially in the legs. Progressive kidney problems in older children and adults with Lowe syndrome can lead to life threatening renal failure and end stage renal disease ESRD .',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mutations in the OCRL gene cause Lowe syndrome. The OCRL gene provides instructions for making an enzyme that helps modify fat lipid molecules called membrane phospholipids. By controlling the levels of specific membrane phospholipids, the OCRL enzyme helps regulate the transport of certain substances to and from the cell membrane. This enzyme is also involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, which is a network of fibers that make up the cell s structural framework. The actin cytoskeleton has several critical functions, including determining cell shape and allowing cells to move. Some mutations in the OCRL gene prevent the production of any OCRL enzyme. Other mutations reduce or eliminate the activity of the enzyme or prevent it from interacting with other proteins within the cell. Researchers are working to determine how OCRL mutations cause the characteristic features of Lowe syndrome. Because the OCRL enzyme is present throughout the body, it is unclear why the medical problems associated with this condition are mostly limited to the brain, kidneys, and eyes. It is possible that other enzymes may be able to compensate for the defective OCRL enzyme in unaffected tissues.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'CHARGE syndrome is a disorder that affects many areas of the body. CHARGE stands for coloboma, heart defect, atresia choanae also known as choanal atresia , retarded growth and development, genital abnormality, and ear abnormality. The pattern of malformations varies among individuals with this disorder, and infants often have multiple life threatening medical conditions. The diagnosis of CHARGE syndrome is based on a combination of major and minor characteristics. The major characteristics of CHARGE syndrome are more specific to this disorder than are the minor characteristics. Many individuals with CHARGE syndrome have a hole in one of the structures of the eye coloboma , which forms during early development. A coloboma may be present in one or both eyes and can affect a person s vision, depending on its size and location. Some people also have small eyes microphthalmia . One or both nasal passages may be narrowed choanal stenosis or completely blocked choanal atresia . Individuals with CHARGE syndrome frequently have cranial nerve abnormalities. The cranial nerves emerge directly from the brain and extend to various areas of the head and neck, controlling muscle movement and transmitting sensory information. Abnormal function of certain cranial nerves can cause swallowing problems, facial paralysis, a sense of smell that is diminished hyposmia or completely absent anosmia , and mild to profound hearing loss. People with CHARGE syndrome also typically have middle and inner ear abnormalities and unusually shaped ears. The minor characteristics of CHARGE syndrome are not specific to this disorder they are frequently present in people without CHARGE syndrome. The minor characteristics include heart defects, slow growth starting in late infancy, developmental delay, and an opening in the lip cleft lip with or without an opening in the roof of the mouth cleft palate . Individuals frequently have hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, which affects the production of hormones that direct sexual development. Males are often born with an unusually small penis micropenis and undescended testes cryptorchidism . External genitalia abnormalities are seen less often in females with CHARGE syndrome. Puberty can be incomplete or delayed. Individuals may have a tracheoesophageal fistula, which is an abnormal connection fistula between the esophagus and the trachea. People with CHARGE syndrome also have distinctive facial features, including a square shaped face and difference in the appearance between the right and left sides of the face facial asymmetry . Individuals have a wide range of cognitive function, from normal intelligence to major learning disabilities with absent speech and poor communication.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mutations in the CHD7 gene cause more than half of all cases of CHARGE syndrome. The CHD7 gene provides instructions for making a protein that most likely regulates gene activity expression by a process known as chromatin remodeling. Chromatin is the complex of DNA and protein that packages DNA into chromosomes. The structure of chromatin can be changed remodeled to alter how tightly DNA is packaged. Chromatin remodeling is one way gene expression is regulated during development. When DNA is tightly packed, gene expression is lower than when DNA is loosely packed. Most mutations in the CHD7 gene lead to the production of an abnormally short, nonfunctional CHD7 protein, which presumably disrupts chromatin remodeling and the regulation of gene expression. Changes in gene expression during embryonic development likely cause the signs and symptoms of CHARGE syndrome. About one third of individuals with CHARGE syndrome do not have an identified mutation in the CHD7 gene. Researchers suspect that other genetic and environmental factors may be involved in these individuals.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Lysinuric protein intolerance is a disorder caused by the body s inability to digest and use certain protein building blocks amino acids , namely lysine, arginine, and ornithine. Because the body cannot effectively break down these amino acids, which are found in many protein rich foods, nausea and vomiting are typically experienced after ingesting protein. People with lysinuric protein intolerance have features associated with protein intolerance, including an enlarged liver and spleen hepatosplenomegaly , short stature, muscle weakness, impaired immune function, and progressively brittle bones that are prone to fracture osteoporosis . A lung disorder called pulmonary alveolar proteinosis may also develop. This disorder is characterized by protein deposits in the lungs, which interfere with lung function and can be life threatening. An accumulation of amino acids in the kidneys can cause end stage renal disease ESRD in which the kidneys become unable to filter fluids and waste products from the body effectively. A lack of certain amino acids can cause elevated levels of ammonia in the blood. If ammonia levels are too high for too long, they can cause coma and intellectual disability. The signs and symptoms of lysinuric protein intolerance typically appear after infants are weaned and receive greater amounts of protein from solid foods.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mutations in the SLC7A7 gene cause lysinuric protein intolerance. The SLC7A7 gene provides instructions for producing a protein called y L amino acid transporter 1 y LAT 1 , which is involved in transporting lysine, arginine, and ornithine between cells in the body. The transportation of amino acids from the small intestines and kidneys to the rest of the body is necessary for the body to be able to use proteins. Mutations in the y LAT 1 protein disrupt the transportation of amino acids, leading to a shortage of lysine, arginine, and ornithine in the body and an abnormally large amount of these amino acids in urine. A shortage of lysine, arginine, and ornithine disrupts many vital functions. Arginine and ornithine are involved in a cellular process called the urea cycle, which processes excess nitrogen in the form of ammonia that is generated when protein is used by the body. The lack of arginine and ornithine in the urea cycle causes elevated levels of ammonia in the blood. Lysine is particularly abundant in collagen molecules that give structure and strength to connective tissues such as skin, tendons, and ligaments. A deficiency of lysine contributes to the short stature and osteoporosis seen in people with lysinuric protein intolerance. Other features of lysinuric protein intolerance are thought to result from abnormal protein transport such as protein deposits in the lungs or a lack of protein that can be used by the body protein malnutrition .',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Cap myopathy is a disorder that primarily affects skeletal muscles, which are muscles that the body uses for movement. People with cap myopathy have muscle weakness myopathy and poor muscle tone hypotonia throughout the body, but they are most severely affected in the muscles of the face, neck, and limbs. The muscle weakness, which begins at birth or during childhood, can worsen over time. Affected individuals may have feeding and swallowing difficulties in infancy. They typically have delayed development of motor skills such as sitting, crawling, standing, and walking. They may fall frequently, tire easily, and have difficulty running, climbing stairs, or jumping. In some cases, the muscles used for breathing are affected, and life threatening breathing difficulties can occur. People with cap myopathy may have a high arch in the roof of the mouth high arched palate , severely drooping eyelids ptosis , and a long face. Some affected individuals develop an abnormally curved lower back lordosis or a spine that curves to the side scoliosis . The name cap myopathy comes from characteristic abnormal cap like structures that can be seen in muscle cells when muscle tissue is viewed under a microscope. The severity of cap myopathy is related to the percentage of muscle cells that have these caps. Individuals in whom 70 to 75 percent of muscle cells have caps typically have severe breathing problems and may not survive childhood, while those in whom 10 to 30 percent of muscle cells have caps have milder symptoms and can live into adulthood.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mutations in the ACTA1, TPM2, or TPM3 genes can cause cap myopathy. These genes provide instructions for producing proteins that play important roles in skeletal muscles. The ACTA1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called skeletal alpha actin, which is part of the actin protein family. Actin proteins are important for cell movement and the tensing of muscle fibers muscle contraction . Thin filaments made up of actin molecules and thick filaments made up of another protein called myosin are the primary components of muscle fibers and are important for muscle contraction. Attachment binding and release of the overlapping thick and thin filaments allows them to move relative to each other so that the muscles can contract. The mutation in the ACTA1 gene that causes cap myopathy results in an abnormal protein that may interfere with the proper assembly of thin filaments. The cap structures in muscle cells characteristic of this disorder are composed of disorganized thin filaments. The TPM2 and TPM3 genes provide instructions for making proteins that are members of the tropomyosin protein family. Tropomyosin proteins regulate muscle contraction by attaching to actin and controlling its binding to myosin. The specific effects of TPM2 and TPM3 gene mutations are unclear, but researchers suggest they may interfere with normal actin myosin binding between the thin and thick filaments, impairing muscle contraction and resulting in the muscle weakness that occurs in cap myopathy.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Pontocerebellar hypoplasia is a group of related conditions that affect the development of the brain. The term pontocerebellar refers to the pons and the cerebellum, which are the brain structures that are most severely affected in many forms of this disorder. The pons is located at the base of the brain in an area called the brainstem, where it transmits signals between the cerebellum and the rest of the brain. The cerebellum, which is located at the back of the brain, normally coordinates movement. The term hypoplasia refers to the underdevelopment of these brain regions. Pontocerebellar hypoplasia also causes impaired growth of other parts of the brain, leading to an unusually small head size microcephaly . This microcephaly is usually not apparent at birth but becomes noticeable as brain growth continues to be slow in infancy and early childhood. Researchers have described at least ten types of pontocerebellar hypoplasia. All forms of this condition are characterized by impaired brain development, delayed development overall, problems with movement, and intellectual disability. The brain abnormalities are usually present at birth, and in some cases they can be detected before birth. Many children with pontocerebellar hypoplasia live only into infancy or childhood, although some affected individuals have lived into adulthood. The two major forms of pontocerebellar hypoplasia are designated as type 1 PCH1 and type 2 PCH2 . In addition to the brain abnormalities described above, PCH1 causes problems with muscle movement resulting from a loss of specialized nerve cells called motor neurons in the spinal cord, similar to another genetic disorder known as spinal muscular atrophy. Individuals with PCH1 also have very weak muscle tone hypotonia , joint deformities called contractures, vision impairment, and breathing and feeding problems that are evident from early infancy. Common features of PCH2 include a lack of voluntary motor skills such as grasping objects, sitting, or walking , problems with swallowing dysphagia , and an absence of communication, including speech. Affected children typically develop temporary jitteriness generalized clonus in early infancy, abnormal patterns of movement described as chorea or dystonia, and stiffness spasticity . Many also have impaired vision and seizures. The other forms of pontocerebellar hypoplasia, designated as type 3 PCH3 through type 10 PCH10 , appear to be rare and have each been reported in only a small number of individuals. Because the different types have overlapping features, and some are caused by mutations in the same genes, researchers have proposed that the types be considered as a spectrum instead of distinct conditions.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Pontocerebellar hypoplasia can result from mutations in several genes. About half of all cases of PCH1 are caused by mutations in the EXOSC3 gene. PCH1 can also result from mutations in several other genes, including TSEN54, RARS2, and VRK1. PCH2 is caused by mutations in the TSEN54, TSEN2, TSEN34, or SEPSECS gene. In addition to causing PCH1 and PCH2, mutations in the TSEN54 gene can cause PCH4 and PCH5. Mutations in the RARS2 gene, in addition to causing PCH1, can result in PCH6. The remaining types of pontocerebellar hypoplasia are caused by mutations in other genes. In some cases, the genetic cause of pontocerebellar hypoplasia is unknown. The genes associated with pontocerebellar hypoplasia appear to play essential roles in the development and survival of nerve cells neurons . Many of these genes are known or suspected to be involved in processing RNA molecules, which are chemical cousins of DNA. Fully processed, mature RNA molecules are essential for the normal functioning of all cells, including neurons. Studies suggest that abnormal RNA processing likely underlies the abnormal brain development characteristic of pontocerebellar hypoplasia, although the exact mechanism is unknown. Researchers hypothesize that developing neurons in certain areas of the brain may be particularly sensitive to problems with RNA processing. Some of the genes associated with pontocerebellar hypoplasia have functions unrelated to RNA processing. In most cases, it is unclear how mutations in these genes impair brain development.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Primary hyperoxaluria is a rare condition characterized by recurrent kidney and bladder stones. The condition often results in end stage renal disease ESRD , which is a life threatening condition that prevents the kidneys from filtering fluids and waste products from the body effectively. Primary hyperoxaluria results from the overproduction of a substance called oxalate. Oxalate is filtered through the kidneys and excreted as a waste product in urine, leading to abnormally high levels of this substance in urine hyperoxaluria . During its excretion, oxalate can combine with calcium to form calcium oxalate, a hard compound that is the main component of kidney and bladder stones. Deposits of calcium oxalate can damage the kidneys and other organs and lead to blood in the urine hematuria , urinary tract infections, kidney damage, ESRD, and injury to other organs. Over time, kidney function decreases such that the kidneys can no longer excrete as much oxalate as they receive. As a result oxalate levels in the blood rise, and the substance gets deposited in tissues throughout the body systemic oxalosis , particularly in bones and the walls of blood vessels. Oxalosis in bones can cause fractures. There are three types of primary hyperoxaluria that differ in their severity and genetic cause. In primary hyperoxaluria type 1, kidney stones typically begin to appear anytime from childhood to early adulthood, and ESRD can develop at any age. Primary hyperoxaluria type 2 is similar to type 1, but ESRD develops later in life. In primary hyperoxaluria type 3, affected individuals often develop kidney stones in early childhood, but few cases of this type have been described so additional signs and symptoms of this type are unclear.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mutations in the AGXT, GRHPR, and HOGA1 genes cause primary hyperoxaluria types 1, 2, and 3, respectively. These genes provide instructions for making enzymes that are involved in the breakdown and processing of protein building blocks amino acids and other compounds. The enzyme produced from the HOGA1 gene is involved in the breakdown of an amino acid, which results in the formation of a compound called glyoxylate. This compound is further broken down by the enzymes produced from the AGXT and GRHPR genes. Mutations in the AGXT, GRHPR, or HOGA1 gene lead to a decrease in production or activity of the respective proteins, which prevents the normal breakdown of glyoxylate. AGXT and GRHPR gene mutations result in an accumulation of glyoxylate, which is then converted to oxalate for removal from the body as a waste product. HOGA1 gene mutations also result in excess oxalate, although researchers are unsure as to how this occurs. Oxalate that is not excreted from the body combines with calcium to form calcium oxalate deposits, which can damage the kidneys and other organs.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Parkes Weber syndrome is a disorder of the vascular system, which is the body s complex network of blood vessels. The vascular system consists of arteries, which carry oxygen rich blood from the heart to the body s various organs and tissues veins, which carry blood back to the heart and capillaries, which are tiny blood vessels that connect arteries and veins. Parkes Weber syndrome is characterized by vascular abnormalities known as capillary malformations and arteriovenous fistulas AVFs , which are present from birth. The capillary malformations increase blood flow near the surface of the skin. They usually look like large, flat, pink stains on the skin, and because of their color are sometimes called port wine stains. In people with Parkes Weber syndrome, capillary malformations occur together with multiple micro AVFs, which are tiny abnormal connections between arteries and veins that affect blood circulation. These AVFs can be associated with life threatening complications including abnormal bleeding and heart failure. Another characteristic feature of Parkes Weber syndrome is overgrowth of one limb, most commonly a leg. Abnormal growth occurs in bones and soft tissues, making one of the limbs longer and larger around than the corresponding one. Some vascular abnormalities seen in Parkes Weber syndrome are similar to those that occur in a condition called capillary malformation arteriovenous malformation syndrome CM AVM . CM AVM and some cases of Parkes Weber syndrome have the same genetic cause.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Some cases of Parkes Weber syndrome result from mutations in the RASA1 gene. When the condition is caused by RASA1 gene mutations, affected individuals usually have multiple capillary malformations. People with Parkes Weber syndrome who do not have multiple capillary malformations are unlikely to have mutations in the RASA1 gene in these cases, the cause of the condition is often unknown. The RASA1 gene provides instructions for making a protein known as p120 RasGAP, which is involved in transmitting chemical signals from outside the cell to the nucleus. These signals help control several important cell functions, including the growth and division proliferation of cells, the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions differentiation , and cell movement. The role of the p120 RasGAP protein is not fully understood, although it appears to be essential for the normal development of the vascular system. Mutations in the RASA1 gene lead to the production of a nonfunctional version of the p120 RasGAP protein. A loss of this protein s activity disrupts tightly regulated chemical signaling during development. However, it is unclear how these changes lead to the specific vascular abnormalities and limb overgrowth seen in people with Parkes Weber syndrome.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Adams Oliver syndrome is a rare condition that is present at birth. The primary features are an abnormality in skin development called aplasia cutis congenita and malformations of the limbs. A variety of other features can occur in people with Adams Oliver syndrome. Most people with Adams Oliver syndrome have aplasia cutis congenita, a condition characterized by localized areas of missing skin typically occurring on the top of the head the skull vertex . In some cases, the bone under the skin is also underdeveloped. Individuals with this condition commonly have scarring and an absence of hair growth in the affected area. Abnormalities of the hands and feet are also common in people with Adams Oliver syndrome. These most often involve the fingers and toes and can include abnormal nails, fingers or toes that are fused together syndactyly , and abnormally short or missing fingers or toes brachydactyly or oligodactyly . In some cases, other bones in the hands, feet, or lower limbs are malformed or missing. Some affected infants have a condition called cutis marmorata telangiectatica congenita. This disorder of the blood vessels causes a reddish or purplish net like pattern on the skin. In addition, people with Adams Oliver syndrome can develop high blood pressure in the blood vessels between the heart and the lungs pulmonary hypertension , which can be life threatening. Other blood vessel problems and heart defects can occur in affected individuals. In some cases, people with Adams Oliver syndrome have neurological problems, such as developmental delay, learning disabilities, or abnormalities in the structure of the brain.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mutations in the ARHGAP31, DLL4, DOCK6, EOGT, NOTCH1, or RBPJ gene can cause Adams Oliver syndrome. Because some affected individuals do not have mutations in one of these genes, it is likely that other genes that have not been identified are also involved in this condition. Each of the known genes plays an important role during embryonic development, and changes in any one of them can impair this tightly controlled process, leading to the signs and symptoms of Adams Oliver syndrome. The proteins produced from the ARHGAP31 and DOCK6 genes are both involved in the regulation of proteins called GTPases, which transmit signals that are critical for various aspects of embryonic development. The ARHGAP31 and DOCK6 proteins appear to be especially important for GTPase regulation during development of the limbs, skull, and heart. GTPases are often called molecular switches because they can be turned on and off. The DOCK6 protein turns them on, and the ARHGAP31 protein turns them off. Mutations in the DOCK6 gene lead to production of an abnormally short DOCK6 protein that is likely unable to turn on GTPases, which reduces their activity. Mutations in the ARHGAP31 gene also decrease GTPase activity by leading to production of an abnormally active ARHGAP31 protein, which turns off GTPases when it normally would not. This decline in GTPase activity leads to the skin problems, bone malformations, and other features characteristic of Adams Oliver syndrome. The proteins produced from the NOTCH1, DLL4, and RBPJ genes are part of a signaling pathway known as the Notch pathway. Notch signaling controls how certain types of cells develop in the growing embryo, including those that form the bones, heart, muscles, nerves, and blood vessels. The Notch1 and DLL4 proteins fit together like a lock and its key to stimulate one part of the Notch pathway, which is important for development of blood vessels. The NOTCH1 and DLL4 gene mutations involved in Adams Oliver syndrome likely impair Notch1 signaling, which may underlie blood vessel and heart abnormalities in some people with Adams Oliver syndrome. Researchers suspect that the other features of the condition may be due to abnormal blood vessel development before birth. Signaling through Notch1 and other Notch proteins stimulates the RBP J protein, produced from the RBPJ gene, to attach bind to specific regions of DNA and control the activity of genes that play a role in cellular development in multiple tissues throughout the body. The RBPJ gene mutations involved in Adams Oliver syndrome alter the region of the RBP J protein that normally binds DNA. The altered protein is unable to bind to DNA, preventing it from turning on particular genes. These changes in gene activity impair the proper development of the skin, bones, and other tissues, leading to the features of Adams Oliver syndrome. Little is known about how mutations in the EOGT gene cause Adams Oliver syndrome. The protein produced from this gene modifies certain proteins by transferring a molecule called N acetylglucosamine to them. It is thought that the EOGT protein modifies Notch proteins, which stimulate the Notch signaling pathway. However, the impact of the modification on Notch signaling is unclear. At least three mutations in the EOGT gene have been identified in people with Adams Oliver syndrome, but how the genetic changes contribute to the signs and symptoms of this disorder is still unknown.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Adams Oliver syndrome can have different inheritance patterns. When caused by mutations in the ARHGAP31, DLL4, NOTCH1, or RBPJ gene, the condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. Autosomal dominant inheritance means that one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. The altered gene is typically inherited from an affected parent. Some cases associated with NOTCH1 gene mutations result from new de novo mutations in the gene that occur during the formation of reproductive cells eggs or sperm or in early embryonic development. These cases occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. When caused by mutations in the DOCK6 or EOGT gene, Adams Oliver syndrome is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. In conditions with this pattern of inheritance, both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Paget disease of bone is a disorder that causes bones to grow larger and weaker than normal. Affected bones may be misshapen and easily broken fractured . The classic form of Paget disease of bone typically appears in middle age or later. It usually occurs in one or a few bones and does not spread from one bone to another. Any bones can be affected, although the disease most commonly affects bones in the spine, pelvis, skull, or legs. Many people with classic Paget disease of bone do not experience any symptoms associated with their bone abnormalities. The disease is often diagnosed unexpectedly by x rays or laboratory tests done for other reasons. People who develop symptoms are most likely to experience pain. The affected bones may themselves be painful, or pain may be caused by arthritis in nearby joints. Arthritis results when the distortion of bones, particularly weight bearing bones in the legs, causes extra wear and tear on the joints. Arthritis most frequently affects the knees and hips in people with this disease. Other complications of Paget disease of bone depend on which bones are affected. If the disease occurs in bones of the skull, it can cause an enlarged head, hearing loss, headaches, and dizziness. If the disease affects bones in the spine, it can lead to numbness and tingling due to pinched nerves and abnormal spinal curvature. In the leg bones, the disease can cause bowed legs and difficulty walking. A rare type of bone cancer called osteosarcoma has been associated with Paget disease of bone. This type of cancer probably occurs in less than 1 in 1,000 people with this disease. Early onset Paget disease of bone is a less common form of the disease that appears in a person s teens or twenties. Its features are similar to those of the classic form of the disease, although it is more likely to affect the skull, spine, and ribs the axial skeleton and the small bones of the hands. The early onset form of the disorder is also associated with hearing loss early in life.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'A combination of genetic and environmental factors likely play a role in causing Paget disease of bone. Researchers have identified changes in several genes that increase the risk of the disorder. Other factors, including infections with certain viruses, may be involved in triggering the disease in people who are at risk. However, the influence of genetic and environmental factors on the development of Paget disease of bone remains unclear. Researchers have identified variations in three genes that are associated with Paget disease of bone SQSTM1, TNFRSF11A, and TNFRSF11B. Mutations in the SQSTM1 gene are the most common genetic cause of classic Paget disease of bone, accounting for 10 to 50 percent of cases that run in families and 5 to 30 percent of cases in which there is no family history of the disease. Variations in the TNFRSF11B gene also appear to increase the risk of the classic form of the disorder, particularly in women. TNFRSF11A mutations cause the early onset form of Paget disease of bone. The SQSTM1, TNFRSF11A, and TNFRSF11B genes are involved in bone remodeling, a normal process in which old bone is broken down and new bone is created to replace it. Bones are constantly being remodeled, and the process is carefully controlled to ensure that bones stay strong and healthy. Paget disease of bone disrupts the bone remodeling process. Affected bone is broken down abnormally and then replaced much faster than usual. When the new bone tissue grows, it is larger, weaker, and less organized than normal bone. It is unclear why these problems with bone remodeling affect some bones but not others in people with this disease. Researchers are looking for additional genes that may influence a person s chances of developing Paget disease of bone. Studies suggest that genetic variations in certain regions of chromosome 2, chromosome 5, and chromosome 10 appear to contribute to disease risk. However, the associated genes on these chromosomes have not been identified.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Most cases of trisomy 13 result from having three copies of chromosome 13 in each cell in the body instead of the usual two copies. The extra genetic material disrupts the normal course of development, causing the characteristic features of trisomy 13. Trisomy 13 can also occur when part of chromosome 13 becomes attached translocated to another chromosome during the formation of reproductive cells eggs and sperm or very early in fetal development. Affected people have two normal copies of chromosome 13, plus an extra copy of chromosome 13 attached to another chromosome. In rare cases, only part of chromosome 13 is present in three copies. The physical signs and symptoms in these cases may be different than those found in full trisomy 13. A small percentage of people with trisomy 13 have an extra copy of chromosome 13 in only some of the body s cells. In these people, the condition is called mosaic trisomy 13. The severity of mosaic trisomy 13 depends on the type and number of cells that have the extra chromosome. The physical features of mosaic trisomy 13 are often milder than those of full trisomy 13.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Most cases of trisomy 13 are not inherited and result from random events during the formation of eggs and sperm in healthy parents. An error in cell division called nondisjunction results in a reproductive cell with an abnormal number of chromosomes. For example, an egg or sperm cell may gain an extra copy of chromosome 13. If one of these atypical reproductive cells contributes to the genetic makeup of a child, the child will have an extra chromosome 13 in each cell of the body. Translocation trisomy 13 can be inherited. An unaffected person can carry a rearrangement of genetic material between chromosome 13 and another chromosome. These rearrangements are called balanced translocations because there is no extra material from chromosome 13. A person with a balanced translocation involving chromosome 13 has an increased chance of passing extra material from chromosome 13 to their children.',\n",

People with Aicardi syndrome have absent or underdeveloped tissue connecting the left and right halves of the brain agenesis or dysgenesis of the corpus callosum . They have seizures beginning in infancy infantile spasms , which tend to progress to recurrent seizures epilepsy that can be difficult to treat. Affected individuals also have chorioretinal lacunae, which are defects in the light sensitive tissue at the back of the eye retina . People with Aicardi syndrome often have additional brain abnormalities, including asymmetry between the two sides of the brain, brain folds and grooves that are small in size or reduced in number, cysts, and enlargement of the fluid filled cavities ventricles near the center of the brain. Some have an unusually small head microcephaly . Most affected individuals have moderate to severe developmental delay and intellectual disability, although some people with this disorder have milder disability. In addition to chorioretinal lacunae, people with Aicardi syndrome may have other eye abnormalities such as small or poorly developed eyes microphthalmia or a gap or hole coloboma in the optic nerve, a structure that carries information from the eye to the brain. These eye abnormalities may cause blindness in affected individuals. Some people with Aicardi syndrome have unusual facial features including a short area between the upper lip and the nose philtrum , a flat nose with an upturned tip, large ears, and sparse eyebrows. Other features of this condition include small hands, hand malformations, and spinal and rib abnormalities leading to progressive abnormal curvature of the spine scoliosis . They often have gastrointestinal problems such as constipation or diarrhea, gastroesophageal reflux, and difficulty feeding. The severity of Aicardi syndrome varies. Some people with this disorder have very severe epilepsy and may not survive past childhood. Less severely affected individuals may live into adulthood with milder signs and symptoms.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'The cause of Aicardi syndrome is unknown. Because it occurs almost exclusively in females, researchers believe that it is probably the result of a mutation in a gene on the X chromosome. People normally have 46 chromosomes in each cell. Two of the 46 chromosomes, known as X and Y, are called sex chromosomes because they help determine whether a person will develop male or female sex characteristics. Genes on these chromosomes are also involved in other functions in the body. Females typically have two X chromosomes 46,XX , and males have one X chromosome and one Y chromosome 46,XY . Early in embryonic development in females, one of the two X chromosomes is permanently inactivated in somatic cells cells other than egg and sperm cells . X inactivation ensures that females, like males, have only one active copy of the X chromosome in each body cell. Usually X inactivation occurs randomly, so that each X chromosome is active in about half the body s cells. Sometimes X inactivation is not random, and one X chromosome is active in more than half of cells. When X inactivation does not occur randomly, it is called skewed X inactivation. Skewed X inactivation sometimes occurs when there is a severe gene mutation in one of the X chromosomes in each cell. Because the cells where this chromosome is active will not be able to survive as well, X inactivation will appear to be skewed. Skewed X inactivation has been identified in girls with Aicardi syndrome, further supporting the idea that the disorder is caused by a mutation in a gene on the X chromosome. However, this gene has not been identified, and it is unknown how the genetic change that causes Aicardi syndrome results in the various signs and symptoms of this disorder.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Nearly all known cases of Aicardi syndrome are sporadic, which means that they are not passed down through generations and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. The disorder is believed to result from new gene mutations. Aicardi syndrome is classified as an X linked dominant condition. While the gene associated with this disorder is not known, it is believed to be located on the X chromosome. In females who have two X chromosomes , a mutation in one of the two copies of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In males who have only one X chromosome , a mutation in the only copy of the gene in each cell is nearly always lethal very early in development, so almost all babies with Aicardi syndrome are female. However, a few affected males with an extra copy of the X chromosome in each cell 47,XXY have been identified. Males with a 47,XXY chromosome pattern also have a condition called Klinefelter syndrome.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Tietz syndrome is caused by mutations in the MITF gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein that plays a role in the development, survival, and function of certain types of cells. Molecules of the MITF protein attach bind to each other or with other proteins that have a similar structure, creating a two protein unit dimer . The dimer attaches to specific areas of DNA and helps control the activity of particular genes. On the basis of this action, the MITF protein is called a transcription factor. The MITF protein helps control the development and function of pigment producing cells called melanocytes. Within these cells, this protein controls production of the pigment melanin, which contributes to hair, eye, and skin color. Melanocytes are also found in the inner ear and play an important role in hearing. Additionally, the MITF protein regulates the development of the retinal pigment epithelium. MITF gene mutations that cause Tietz syndrome either delete or change a single protein building block amino acid in an area of the MITF protein known as the basic motif region. Dimers incorporating the abnormal MITF protein cannot be transported into the cell nucleus to bind with DNA. As a result, most of the dimers are unavailable to bind to DNA, which affects the development of melanocytes and the production of melanin. The resulting reduction or absence of melanocytes in the inner ear leads to hearing loss. Decreased melanin production hypopigmentation accounts for the light skin and hair color and the retinal pigment epithelium changes that are characteristic of Tietz syndrome. Researchers suggest that Tietz syndrome may represent a severe form of a disorder called Waardenburg syndrome, which can also be caused by MITF gene mutations.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Tangier disease is an inherited disorder characterized by significantly reduced levels of high density lipoprotein HDL in the blood. HDL transports cholesterol and certain fats called phospholipids from the body s tissues to the liver, where they are removed from the blood. HDL is often referred to as good cholesterol because high levels of this substance reduce the chances of developing heart and blood vessel cardiovascular disease. Because people with Tangier disease have very low levels of HDL, they have a moderately increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Additional signs and symptoms of Tangier disease include a slightly elevated amount of fat in the blood mild hypertriglyceridemia disturbances in nerve function neuropathy and enlarged, orange colored tonsils. Affected individuals often develop atherosclerosis, which is an accumulation of fatty deposits and scar like tissue in the lining of the arteries. Other features of this condition may include an enlarged spleen splenomegaly , an enlarged liver hepatomegaly , clouding of the clear covering of the eye corneal clouding , and type 2 diabetes.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'STING associated vasculopathy with onset in infancy SAVI is a disorder involving abnormal inflammation throughout the body, especially in the skin, blood vessels, and lungs. Inflammation normally occurs when the immune system sends signaling molecules and white blood cells to a site of injury or disease to fight microbial invaders and help with tissue repair. Excessive inflammation damages the body s own cells and tissues. Disorders such as SAVI that result from abnormally increased inflammation are known as autoinflammatory diseases. The signs and symptoms of SAVI begin in the first few months of life, and most are related to problems with blood vessels vasculopathy and damage to the tissues that rely on these vessels for their blood supply. Affected infants develop areas of severely damaged skin lesions , particularly on the face, ears, nose, fingers, and toes. These lesions begin as rashes and can progress to become wounds ulcers and dead tissue necrosis . The skin problems, which worsen in cold weather, can lead to complications such as scarred ears, a hole in the tissue that separates the two nostrils nasal septum perforation , or fingers or toes that require amputation. Individuals with SAVI also have a purplish skin discoloration livedo reticularis caused by abnormalities in the tiny blood vessels of the skin. Affected individuals may also experience episodes of Raynaud phenomenon, in which the fingers and toes turn white or blue in response to cold temperature or other stresses. This effect occurs because of problems with the small vessels that carry blood to the extremities. In addition to problems affecting the skin, people with SAVI have recurrent low grade fevers and swollen lymph nodes. They may also develop widespread lung damage interstitial lung disease that can lead to the formation of scar tissue in the lungs pulmonary fibrosis and difficulty breathing these respiratory complications can become life threatening. Rarely, muscle inflammation myositis and joint stiffness also occur.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Pitt Hopkins syndrome is a condition characterized by intellectual disability and developmental delay, breathing problems, recurrent seizures epilepsy , and distinctive facial features. People with Pitt Hopkins syndrome have moderate to severe intellectual disability. Most affected individuals have delayed development of mental and motor skills psychomotor delay . They are delayed in learning to walk and developing fine motor skills such as picking up small items with their fingers. People with Pitt Hopkins syndrome typically do not develop speech some may learn to say a few words. Many affected individuals exhibit features of autistic spectrum disorders, which are characterized by impaired communication and socialization skills. Breathing problems in individuals with Pitt Hopkins syndrome are characterized by episodes of rapid breathing hyperventilation followed by periods in which breathing slows or stops apnea . These episodes can cause a lack of oxygen in the blood, leading to a bluish appearance of the skin or lips cyanosis . In some cases, the lack of oxygen can cause loss of consciousness. Some older individuals with Pitt Hopkins syndrome develop widened and rounded tips of the fingers and toes clubbing because of recurrent episodes of decreased oxygen in the blood. The breathing problems occur only when the person is awake and typically first appear in mid childhood, but they can begin as early as infancy. Episodes of hyperventilation and apnea can be triggered by emotions such as excitement or anxiety or by extreme tiredness fatigue . Epilepsy occurs in most people with Pitt Hopkins syndrome and usually begins during childhood, although it can be present from birth. Individuals with Pitt Hopkins syndrome have distinctive facial features that include thin eyebrows, sunken eyes, a prominent nose with a high nasal bridge, a pronounced double curve of the upper lip Cupid s bow , a wide mouth with full lips, and widely spaced teeth. The ears are usually thick and cup shaped. Children with Pitt Hopkins syndrome typically have a happy, excitable demeanor with frequent smiling, laughter, and hand flapping movements. However, they can also experience anxiety and behavioral problems. Other features of Pitt Hopkins syndrome may include constipation and other gastrointestinal problems, an unusually small head microcephaly , nearsightedness myopia , eyes that do not look in the same direction strabismus , short stature, and minor brain abnormalities. Affected individuals may also have small hands and feet, a single crease across the palms of the hands, flat feet pes planus , or unusually fleshy pads at the tips of the fingers and toes.

       "  'answer': 'Mutations in the TCF4 gene cause Pitt Hopkins syndrome. This gene provides instructions for making a protein that attaches binds to other proteins and then binds to specific regions of DNA to help control the activity of many other genes. On the basis of its DNA binding and gene controlling activities, the TCF4 protein is known as a transcription factor. The TCF4 protein plays a role in the maturation of cells to carry out specific functions cell differentiation and the self destruction of cells apoptosis . TCF4 gene mutations disrupt the protein s ability to bind to DNA and control the activity of certain genes. These disruptions, particularly the inability of the TCF4 protein to control the activity of genes involved in nervous system development and function, contribute to the signs and symptoms of Pitt Hopkins syndrome. Furthermore, additional proteins interact with the TCF4 protein to carry out specific functions. When the TCF4 protein is nonfunctional, these other proteins are also unable to function normally. It is also likely that the loss of the normal proteins that are attached to the nonfunctional TCF4 proteins contribute to the features of this condition. The loss of one protein in particular, the ASCL1 protein, is thought to be associated with breathing problems in people with Pitt Hopkins syndrome.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Spinocerebellar ataxia type 36 SCA36 is a condition characterized by progressive problems with movement that typically begin in mid adulthood. People with this condition initially experience problems with coordination and balance ataxia . Affected individuals often have exaggerated reflexes hyperreflexia and problems with speech dysarthria . They also usually develop muscle twitches fasciculations of the tongue and over time, the muscles in the tongue waste away atrophy . These tongue problems can cause difficulties swallowing liquids. As the condition progresses, individuals with SCA36 develop muscle atrophy in the legs, forearms, and hands. Another common feature of SCA36 is the atrophy of specialized nerve cells that control muscle movement motor neurons , which can contribute to the tongue and limb muscle atrophy in affected individuals. Some people with SCA36 have abnormalities of the eye muscles, which can lead to involuntary eye movements nystagmus , rapid eye movements saccades , trouble moving the eyes side to side oculomotor apraxia , and droopy eyelids ptosis . Sensorineural hearing loss, which is hearing loss caused by changes in the inner ear, may also occur in people with SCA36. Brain imaging of people with SCA36 shows progressive atrophy of various parts of the brain, particularly within the cerebellum, which is the area of the brain involved in coordinating movements. Over time, the loss of cells in the cerebellum causes the movement problems characteristic of SCA36. In older affected individuals, the frontal lobes of the brain may show atrophy resulting in loss of executive function, which is the ability to plan and implement actions and develop problem solving strategies. Signs and symptoms of SCA36 typically begin in a person s forties or fifties but can appear anytime during adulthood. People with SCA36 have a normal lifespan and are usually mobile for 15 to 20 years after they are diagnosed.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'SCA36 is caused by mutations in the NOP56 gene. The NOP56 gene provides instructions for making a protein called nucleolar protein 56, which is primarily found in the nucleus of nerve cells neurons , particularly those in the cerebellum. This protein is one part subunit of the ribonucleoprotein complex, which is composed of proteins and molecules of RNA, DNA s chemical cousin. The ribonucleoprotein complex is needed to make cellular structures called ribosomes, which process the cell s genetic instructions to create proteins. The NOP56 gene mutations that cause SCA36 involve a string of six DNA building blocks nucleotides located in an area of the gene known as intron 1. This string of six nucleotides known as a hexanucleotide is represented by the letters GGCCTG and normally appears multiple times in a row. In healthy individuals, GGCCTG is repeated 3 to 14 times within the gene. In people with SCA36, GGCCTG is repeated at least 650 times. It is unclear if 15 to 649 repeats of this hexanucleotide cause any signs or symptoms. To make proteins from the genetic instructions carried in genes, a molecule called messenger RNA mRNA is formed. This molecule acts as a genetic blueprint for protein production. However, a large increase in the number of GGCCTG repeats in the NOP56 gene disrupts the normal structure of NOP56 mRNA. Abnormal NOP56 mRNA molecules form clumps called RNA foci within the nucleus of neurons. Other proteins become trapped in the RNA foci, where they cannot function. These proteins may be important for controlling gene activity or protein production. Additionally, researchers believe that the large expansion of the hexanucleotide repeat in the NOP56 gene may reduce the activity of a nearby gene called MIR1292. The MIR1292 gene provides instructions for making a type of RNA that regulates the activity expression of genes that produce proteins called glutamate receptors. These proteins are found on the surface of neurons and allow these cells to communicate with one another. A decrease in the production of Mir1292 RNA can lead to an increase in the production of glutamate receptors. The increased receptor activity may overexcite neurons, which disrupts normal communication between cells and can contribute to ataxia. The combination of RNA foci and overly excited neurons likely leads to the death of these cells over time. Because the NOP56 gene is especially active in neurons in the cerebellum, these cells are particularly affected by expansion of the gene, leading to cerebellar atrophy. Deterioration in this part of the brain leads to ataxia and the other signs and symptoms of SCA36.',\n",

In most cases, an affected person has one parent with the condition. In conditions that are caused by repeated segments of DNA, the number of repeats often increases when the altered gene is passed down from one generation to the next. Additionally, a larger number of repeats is usually associated with an earlier onset of signs and symptoms. This phenomenon is called anticipation. Some families affected by SCA36 have demonstrated anticipation while others have not. When anticipation is observed in SCA36, the mutation is most often passed down from the affected father.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'L1 syndrome is an inherited disorder that primarily affects the nervous system. L1 syndrome involves a variety of features that were once thought to be distinct disorders, but are now considered to be part of the same syndrome. The most common characteristics of L1 syndrome are muscle stiffness spasticity of the lower limbs, intellectual disability, increased fluid in the center of the brain hydrocephalus , and thumbs bent toward the palm adducted thumbs . People with L1 syndrome can also have difficulty speaking aphasia , seizures, and underdeveloped or absent tissue connecting the left and right halves of the brain agenesis of the corpus callosum . The symptoms of L1 syndrome vary widely among affected individuals, even among members of the same family.

Affected individuals have abnormally large joints that can cause pain and restrict movement, limiting physical activity. These joint problems can also lead to arthritis. Other skeletal features may include a rounded upper back that also curves to the side kyphoscoliosis , severely flattened bones of the spine platyspondyly , dumbbell shaped bones in the arms and legs, long and knobby fingers, and an inward and upward turning foot clubfoot . Individuals with Kniest dysplasia have a round, flat face with bulging and wide set eyes. Some affected infants are born with an opening in the roof of the mouth called a cleft palate. Infants may also have breathing problems due to weakness of the windpipe. Severe nearsightedness myopia and other eye problems are common in Kniest dysplasia.

       "  'answer': 'Kniest dysplasia is one of a spectrum of skeletal disorders caused by mutations in the COL2A1 gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein that forms type II collagen. This type of collagen is found mostly in the clear gel that fills the eyeball the vitreous and in cartilage. Cartilage is a tough, flexible tissue that makes up much of the skeleton during early development. Most cartilage is later converted to bone, except for the cartilage that continues to cover and protect the ends of bones and is present in the nose and external ears. Type II collagen is essential for the normal development of bones and other connective tissues that form the body s supportive framework. Most mutations in the COL2A1 gene that cause Kniest dysplasia interfere with the assembly of type II collagen molecules. Abnormal collagen prevents bones and other connective tissues from developing properly, which leads to the signs and symptoms of Kniest dysplasia.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Collagen VI related myopathy is a group of disorders that affect skeletal muscles which are the muscles used for movement and connective tissue which provides strength and flexibility to the skin, joints, and other structures throughout the body . Most affected individuals have muscle weakness and joint deformities called contractures that restrict movement of the affected joints and worsen over time. Researchers have described several forms of collagen VI related myopathy, which range in severity Bethlem myopathy is the mildest, an intermediate form is moderate in severity, and Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy is the most severe. People with Bethlem myopathy usually have loose joints joint laxity and weak muscle tone hypotonia in infancy, but they develop contractures during childhood, typically in their fingers, wrists, elbows, and ankles. Muscle weakness can begin at any age but often appears in childhood to early adulthood. The muscle weakness is slowly progressive, with about two thirds of affected individuals over age 50 needing walking assistance. Older individuals may develop weakness in respiratory muscles, which can cause breathing problems. Some people with this mild form of collagen VI related myopathy have skin abnormalities, including small bumps called follicular hyperkeratosis on the arms and legs soft, velvety skin on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet and abnormal wound healing that creates shallow scars. The intermediate form of collagen VI related myopathy is characterized by muscle weakness that begins in infancy. Affected children are able to walk, although walking becomes increasingly difficult starting in early adulthood. They develop contractures in the ankles, elbows, knees, and spine in childhood. In some affected people, the respiratory muscles are weakened, requiring people to use a machine to help them breathe mechanical ventilation , particularly during sleep. People with Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy have severe muscle weakness beginning soon after birth. Some affected individuals are never able to walk and others can walk only with support. Those who can walk often lose the ability, usually in adolescence. Individuals with Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy develop contractures in their neck, hips, and knees, which further impair movement. There may be joint laxity in the fingers, wrists, toes, ankles, and other joints. Some affected individuals need continuous mechanical ventilation to help them breathe. As in Bethlem myopathy, some people with Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy have follicular hyperkeratosis soft, velvety skin on the palms and soles and abnormal wound healing. Individuals with collagen VI related myopathy often have signs and symptoms of multiple forms of this condition, so it can be difficult to assign a specific diagnosis. The overlap in disease features, in addition to their common cause, is why these once separate conditions are now considered part of the same disease spectrum.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mutations in the COL6A1, COL6A2, and COL6A3 genes can cause the various forms of collagen VI related myopathy. These genes each provide instructions for making one component of a protein called type VI collagen. Type VI collagen makes up part of the extracellular matrix that surrounds muscle cells and connective tissue. This matrix is an intricate lattice that forms in the space between cells and provides structural support. The extracellular matrix is necessary for cell stability and growth. Research suggests that type VI collagen helps secure and organize the extracellular matrix by linking the matrix to the cells it surrounds. Mutations in the COL6A1, COL6A2, and COL6A3 genes result in a decrease or lack of type VI collagen or the production of abnormal type VI collagen. While it is difficult to predict which type of mutation will lead to which form of collagen VI related myopathy, in general, lower amounts of type VI collagen lead to more severe signs and symptoms that begin earlier in life. Changes in type VI collagen structure or production lead to an unstable extracellular matrix that is no longer attached to cells. As a result, the stability of the surrounding muscle cells and connective tissue progressively declines, which leads to the muscle weakness, contractures, and other signs and symptoms of collagen VI related myopathy.',\n",

People with KID syndrome usually have keratitis, which is inflammation of the front surface of the eye the cornea . The keratitis may cause pain, increased sensitivity to light photophobia , abnormal blood vessel growth over the cornea neovascularization , and scarring. Over time, affected individuals experience a loss of sharp vision reduced visual acuity in severe cases the keratitis can lead to blindness. Most people with KID syndrome have thick, hard skin on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet palmoplantar keratoderma . Affected individuals also have thick, reddened patches of skin erythrokeratoderma that are dry and scaly ichthyosis . These dry patches can occur anywhere on the body, although they most commonly affect the neck, groin, and armpits. Breaks in the skin often occur and may lead to infections. In severe cases these infections can be life threatening, especially in infancy. Approximately 12 percent of people with KID syndrome develop a type of skin cancer called squamous cell carcinoma, which may also affect mucous membranes such as the lining of the mouth. Partial hair loss is a common feature of KID syndrome, and often affects the eyebrows and eyelashes. Affected individuals may also have small, abnormally formed nails.

       "  'answer': 'KID syndrome is caused by mutations in the GJB2 gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein called gap junction beta 2, more commonly known as connexin 26. Connexin 26 is a member of the connexin protein family. Connexin proteins form channels called gap junctions that permit the transport of nutrients, charged atoms ions , and signaling molecules between neighboring cells that are in contact with each other. Gap junctions made with connexin 26 transport potassium ions and certain small molecules. Connexin 26 is found in cells throughout the body, including the inner ear and the skin. In the inner ear, channels made from connexin 26 are found in a snail shaped structure called the cochlea. These channels may help to maintain the proper level of potassium ions required for the conversion of sound waves to electrical nerve impulses. This conversion is essential for normal hearing. In addition, connexin 26 may be involved in the maturation of certain cells in the cochlea. Connexin 26 also plays a role in the growth and maturation of the outermost layer of skin the epidermis . The GJB2 gene mutations that cause KID syndrome change single protein building blocks amino acids in connexin 26. The mutations are thought to result in channels that constantly leak ions, which impairs the health of the cells and increases cell death. Death of cells in the skin and the inner ear may underlie the ichthyosis and deafness that occur in KID syndrome. It is unclear how GJB2 gene mutations affect the eye. Because at least one of the GJB2 gene mutations identified in people with KID syndrome also occurs in hystrix like ichthyosis with deafness HID , a disorder with similar features but without keratitis, many researchers categorize KID syndrome and HID as a single disorder, which they call KID HID. It is not known why some people with this mutation have eye problems while others do not.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Leydig cell hypoplasia is a condition that affects male sexual development. It is characterized by underdevelopment hypoplasia of Leydig cells in the testes. Leydig cells secrete male sex hormones androgens that are important for normal male sexual development before birth and during puberty. In Leydig cell hypoplasia, affected individuals with a typical male chromosomal pattern 46,XY may have a range of genital abnormalities. Affected males may have a small penis micropenis , the opening of the urethra on the underside of the penis hypospadias , or a scrotum divided into two lobes bifid scrotum . Because of these abnormalities, the external genitalia may not look clearly male or clearly female ambiguous genitalia . In more severe cases of Leydig cell hypoplasia, people with a typical male chromosomal pattern 46,XY have female external genitalia. They have small testes that are undescended, which means they are abnormally located in the pelvis, abdomen, or groin. People with this form of the disorder do not develop secondary sex characteristics, such as increased body hair, at puberty. Some researchers refer to this form of Leydig cell hypoplasia as type 1 and designate less severe cases as type 2.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mutations in the LHCGR gene cause Leydig cell hypoplasia. The LHCGR gene provides instructions for making a protein called the luteinizing hormone chorionic gonadotropin receptor. Receptor proteins have specific sites into which certain other proteins, called ligands, fit like keys into locks. Together, ligands and their receptors trigger signals that affect cell development and function. The protein produced from the LHCGR gene acts as a receptor for two ligands luteinizing hormone and a similar hormone called chorionic gonadotropin. The receptor allows the body to respond appropriately to these hormones. In males, chorionic gonadotropin stimulates the development of cells in the testes called Leydig cells, and luteinizing hormone triggers these cells to produce androgens. Androgens, including testosterone, are the hormones that control male sexual development and reproduction. In females, luteinizing hormone triggers the release of egg cells from the ovary ovulation . Chorionic gonadotropin is produced during pregnancy and helps maintain conditions necessary for the pregnancy to continue. The LHCGR gene mutations that cause Leydig cell hypoplasia disrupt luteinizing hormone chorionic gonadotropin receptor function, impeding the body s ability to react to these hormones. In males, the mutations result in poorly developed or absent Leydig cells and impaired production of testosterone. A lack of testosterone interferes with the development of male reproductive organs before birth and the changes that appear at puberty. Mutations that prevent the production of any functional receptor protein cause the more severe features of Leydig cell hypoplasia, and mutations that allow some receptor protein function cause milder signs and symptoms.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Congenital hepatic fibrosis is a disease of the liver that is present from birth. The liver has many important functions, including producing various molecules needed by the body and breaking down other molecules so that their components can be used or eliminated. Congenital hepatic fibrosis is characterized by malformation of the bile ducts and of the blood vessels of the hepatic portal system. Bile ducts carry bile a fluid that helps to digest fats from the liver to the gallbladder and small intestine. The hepatic portal system is a branching network of veins portal veins that carry blood from the gastrointestinal tract to the liver for processing. A buildup of scar tissue fibrosis in the portal tracts also occurs in this disorder. Portal tracts are structures in the liver that bundle the vessels through which blood, lymph, and bile flow, and fibrosis in the portal tracts can restrict the normal movement of fluids in these vessels. Lymph is a fluid that helps exchange immune cells, proteins, and other substances between the blood and tissues. Constriction of the portal veins due to malformation and portal tract fibrosis results in high blood pressure in the hepatic portal system portal hypertension . Portal hypertension impairs the flow of blood from the gastrointestinal tract, causing an increase in pressure in the veins of the esophagus, stomach, and intestines. These veins may stretch and their walls may become thin, leading to a risk of abnormal bleeding. People with congenital hepatic fibrosis have an enlarged liver and spleen hepatosplenomegaly . The liver is abnormally shaped. Affected individuals also have an increased risk of infection of the bile ducts cholangitis , hard deposits in the gallbladder or bile ducts gallstones , and cancer of the liver or gallbladder. Congenital hepatic fibrosis may occur alone, in which case it is called isolated congenital hepatic fibrosis. More frequently, it occurs as a feature of genetic syndromes that also affect the kidneys the renal system , such as polycystic kidney disease PKD .',\n",

The gene changes that cause isolated congenital hepatic fibrosis are unknown. Congenital hepatic fibrosis is caused by problems in the development of the portal veins and bile ducts. These problems include malformation of embryonic structures called ductal plates. Each ductal plate is a cylinder of cells surrounding branches of the portal veins. During development before birth, the ductal plates normally develop into the network of bile ducts. In congenital hepatic fibrosis, the development of the ductal plates does not proceed normally, resulting in the persistence of immature bile ducts. Branching of the portal vein network also proceeds abnormally, and excess fibrous tissue develops in the portal tracts. The malformation of the portal veins and bile ducts disrupts the normal flow of blood and bile, which leads to the progressive signs and symptoms of congenital hepatic fibrosis.',\n",

There are two types of this condition lactate dehydrogenase A deficiency sometimes called glycogen storage disease XI and lactate dehydrogenase B deficiency. People with lactate dehydrogenase A deficiency experience fatigue, muscle pain, and cramps during exercise exercise intolerance . In some people with lactate dehydrogenase A deficiency, high intensity exercise or other strenuous activity leads to the breakdown of muscle tissue rhabdomyolysis . The destruction of muscle tissue releases a protein called myoglobin, which is processed by the kidneys and released in the urine myoglobinuria . Myoglobin causes the urine to be red or brown. This protein can also damage the kidneys, in some cases leading to life threatening kidney failure. Some people with lactate dehydrogenase A deficiency develop skin rashes. The severity of the signs and symptoms among individuals with lactate dehydrogenase A deficiency varies greatly. People with lactate dehydrogenase B deficiency typically do not have any signs or symptoms of the condition. They do not have difficulty with physical activity or any specific physical features related to the condition.

       "  'answer': 'Mutations in the LDHA gene cause lactate dehydrogenase A deficiency, and mutations in the LDHB gene cause lactate dehydrogenase B deficiency. These genes provide instructions for making the lactate dehydrogenase A and lactate dehydrogenase B pieces subunits of the lactate dehydrogenase enzyme. This enzyme is found throughout the body and is important for creating energy for cells. There are five different forms of this enzyme, each made up of four protein subunits. Various combinations of the lactate dehydrogenase A and lactate dehydrogenase B subunits make up the different forms of the enzyme. The version of lactate dehydrogenase made of four lactate dehydrogenase A subunits is found primarily in skeletal muscles, which are muscles used for movement. Skeletal muscles need large amounts of energy during high intensity physical activity when the body s oxygen intake is not sufficient for the amount of energy required anaerobic exercise . During anaerobic exercise, the lactate dehydrogenase enzyme is involved in the breakdown of sugar stored in the muscles in the form of glycogen to create additional energy. During the final stage of glycogen breakdown, lactate dehydrogenase converts a molecule called pyruvate to a similar molecule called lactate. Mutations in the LDHA gene result in the production of an abnormal lactate dehydrogenase A subunit that cannot attach bind to other subunits to form the lactate dehydrogenase enzyme. A lack of functional subunit reduces the amount of enzyme that is formed, mostly affecting skeletal muscles. As a result, glycogen is not broken down efficiently, leading to decreased energy in muscle cells. When muscle cells do not get sufficient energy during exercise or strenuous activity, the muscles become weak and muscle tissue can break down, as experienced by people with lactate dehydrogenase A deficiency. The version of lactate dehydrogenase made of four lactate dehydrogenase B subunits is found primarily in heart cardiac muscle. In cardiac muscle, lactate dehydrogenase converts lactate to pyruvate, which can participate in other chemical reactions to create energy. LDHB gene mutations lead to the production of an abnormal lactate dehydrogenase B subunit that cannot form the lactate dehydrogenase enzyme. Even though lactate dehydrogenase activity is decreased in the cardiac muscle of people with lactate dehydrogenase B deficiency, they do not appear to have any signs or symptoms related to their condition. It is unclear why this type of enzyme deficiency does not cause any health problems.',\n",

Each of these genes provides instructions for making one part subunit of a protein called fibrinogen. This protein is important for blood clot formation coagulation , which is needed to stop excessive bleeding after injury. In response to injury, fibrinogen is converted to fibrin, the main protein in blood clots. Fibrin proteins attach to each other, forming a stable network that makes up the blood clot. Congenital afibrinogenemia is caused by a complete absence of fibrinogen protein. Most FGA, FGB, and FGG gene mutations that cause this condition result in a premature stop signal in the instructions for making the respective protein. If any protein is made, it is nonfunctional. When any one subunit is missing, the fibrinogen protein is not assembled, which results in the absence of fibrin.

       "  'answer': 'Cold induced sweating syndrome is characterized by problems with regulating body temperature and other abnormalities affecting many parts of the body. In infancy, the features of this condition are often known as Crisponi syndrome. Researchers originally thought that cold induced sweating syndrome and Crisponi syndrome were separate disorders, but it is now widely believed that they represent the same condition at different times during life. Infants with Crisponi syndrome have unusual facial features, including a flat nasal bridge, upturned nostrils, a long space between the nose and upper lip philtrum , a high arched roof of the mouth palate , a small chin micrognathia , and low set ears. The muscles in the lower part of the face are weak, leading to severe feeding difficulties, excessive drooling, and breathing problems. Other physical abnormalities associated with Crisponi syndrome include a scaly skin rash, an inability to fully extend the elbows, overlapping fingers and tightly fisted hands, and malformations of the feet and toes. Affected infants startle easily and often tense their facial muscles into a grimace like expression. By six months of age, infants with Crisponi syndrome develop unexplained high fevers that increase the risk of seizures and sudden death. Many of the health problems associated with Crisponi syndrome improve with time, and affected individuals who survive the newborn period go on to develop other features of cold induced sweating syndrome in early childhood. Within the first decade of life, affected individuals begin having episodes of profuse sweating hyperhidrosis and shivering involving the face, torso, and arms. The excessive sweating is usually triggered by exposure to temperatures below about 65 or 70 degrees Fahrenheit, but it can also be triggered by nervousness or eating sugary foods. Paradoxically, affected individuals tend not to sweat in warmer conditions, instead becoming flushed and overheated in hot environments. Adolescents with cold induced sweating syndrome typically develop abnormal side to side and front to back curvature of the spine scoliosis and kyphosis, often called kyphoscoliosis when they occur together . Although infants may develop life threatening fevers, affected individuals who survive infancy have a normal life expectancy.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'About 90 percent of cases of cold induced sweating syndrome and Crisponi syndrome result from mutations in the CRLF1 gene. These cases are designated as CISS1. The remaining 10 percent of cases are caused by mutations in the CLCF1 gene and are designated as CISS2. The proteins produced from the CRLF1 and CLCF1 genes work together as part of a signaling pathway that is involved in the normal development of the nervous system. This pathway appears to be particularly important for the development and maintenance of motor neurons, which are nerve cells that control muscle movement. Studies suggest that this pathway also has a role in a part of the nervous system known as the sympathetic nervous system, specifically in the regulation of sweating in response to temperature changes and other factors. The proteins produced from the CRLF1 and CLCF1 genes appear to be critical for the normal development and maturation of nerve cells that control the activity of sweat glands. Additionally, the CRLF1 and CLCF1 genes likely have functions outside the nervous system, including roles in the body s inflammatory response and in bone development. However, little is known about their involvement in these processes. Mutations in either the CRLF1 or CLCF1 gene disrupt the normal development of several body systems, including the nervous system. The role of these genes in sympathetic nervous system development may help explain the abnormal sweating that is characteristic of this condition, including unusual sweating patterns and related problems with body temperature regulation. The involvement of these genes in motor neuron development and bone development provides clues to some of the other signs and symptoms of cold induced sweating syndrome, including distinctive facial features, facial muscle weakness, and skeletal abnormalities. However, little is known about how CRLF1 or CLCF1 gene mutations underlie these other features of cold induced sweating syndrome.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Koolen de Vries syndrome is caused by genetic changes that eliminate the function of one copy of the KANSL1 gene in each cell. Most affected individuals are missing a small amount of genetic material, including the KANSL1 gene, from one copy of chromosome 17. This type of genetic abnormality is called a microdeletion. A small number of individuals with Koolen de Vries syndrome do not have a chromosome 17 microdeletion but instead have a mutation within the KANSL1 gene that causes one copy of the gene to be nonfunctional. The microdeletion that causes Koolen de Vries syndrome occurs on the long q arm of chromosome 17 at a location designated q21.31. While the exact size of the deletion varies among affected individuals, most are missing a sequence of about 500,000 DNA building blocks base pairs containing several genes. However, because individuals with KANSL1 gene mutations have the same signs and symptoms as those with the microdeletion, researchers have concluded that the loss of this gene accounts for the features of this disorder. The KANSL1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that helps regulate gene activity expression by modifying chromatin. Chromatin is the complex of DNA and protein that packages DNA into chromosomes. The protein produced from the KANSL1 gene is found in most organs and tissues of the body before birth and throughout life. By its involvement in controlling the activity of other genes, this protein plays an important role in the development and function of many parts of the body. Loss of one copy of this gene impairs normal development and function, but the relationship of KANSL1 gene loss to the specific signs and symptoms of Koolen de Vries syndrome is unclear.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Koolen de Vries syndrome is considered an autosomal dominant condition because a deletion or mutation affecting one copy of the KANSL1 gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In most cases, the disorder is not inherited. The genetic change occurs most often as a random event during the formation of reproductive cells eggs and sperm or in early fetal development. Affected people typically have no history of the disorder in their family. While it is possible for them to pass the condition on to their children, no individuals with Koolen de Vries syndrome have been known to reproduce. Most people with Koolen de Vries syndrome caused by a deletion have had at least one parent with a common variant of the 17q21.31 region of chromosome 17 called the H2 lineage. This variant is found in 20 percent of people of European and Middle Eastern descent, although it is rare in other populations. In the H2 lineage, a 900 kb segment of DNA, which includes the region deleted in most cases of Koolen de Vries syndrome, has undergone an inversion. An inversion involves two breaks in a chromosome the resulting piece of DNA is reversed and reinserted into the chromosome. People with the H2 lineage have no health problems related to the inversion. However, genetic material can be lost or duplicated when the inversion is passed to the next generation. Other, unknown factors are thought to play a role in this process. So while the inversion is very common, only an extremely small percentage of parents with the inversion have a child affected by Koolen de Vries syndrome.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Stve Wiedemann syndrome is a severe condition characterized by bone abnormalities and dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system, which controls involuntary body processes such as the regulation of breathing rate and body temperature. The condition is apparent from birth, and its key features include abnormal curvature bowing of the long bones in the legs, difficulty feeding and swallowing, and episodes of dangerously high body temperature hyperthermia . In addition to bowed legs, affected infants can have bowed arms, permanently bent fingers and toes camptodactyly , and joint deformities contractures in the elbows and knees that restrict their movement. Other features include abnormalities of the pelvic bones the ilia and reduced bone mineral density osteopenia . In infants with Stve Wiedemann syndrome, dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system typically leads to difficulty feeding and swallowing, breathing problems, and episodes of hyperthermia. Affected infants may also sweat excessively, even when the body temperature is not elevated, or have a reduced ability to feel pain. Many babies with this condition do not survive past infancy because of the problems regulating breathing and body temperature however, some people with Stve Wiedemann syndrome live into adolescence or later. Problems with breathing and swallowing usually improve in affected children who survive infancy however, they still have difficulty regulating body temperature. In addition, the leg bowing worsens, and children with Stve Wiedemann syndrome may develop prominent joints, an abnormal curvature of the spine scoliosis , and spontaneous bone fractures. Some affected individuals have a smooth tongue that lacks the bumps that house taste buds fungiform papillae . Affected children may also lose certain reflexes, particularly the reflex to blink when something touches the eye corneal reflex and the knee jerk reflex patellar reflex . Another condition once known as Schwartz Jampel syndrome type 2 is now considered to be part of Stve Wiedemann syndrome.

       "  'answer': 'Stve Wiedemann syndrome is usually caused by mutations in the LIFR gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein called leukemia inhibitory factor receptor LIFR . Receptor proteins have specific sites into which certain other proteins, called ligands, fit like keys into locks. Together, ligands and their receptors trigger signals that affect cell development and function. The LIFR protein acts as a receptor for a ligand known as leukemia inhibitory factor LIF . LIFR signaling can control several cellular processes, including growth and division proliferation , maturation differentiation , and survival. First found to be important in blocking inhibiting growth of blood cancer leukemia cells, this signaling is also involved in the formation of bone and the development of nerve cells. It appears to play an important role in normal development and functioning of the autonomic nervous system. Most LIFR gene mutations that cause Stve Wiedemann syndrome prevent production of any LIFR protein. Other mutations lead to production of an altered protein that likely cannot function. Without functional LIFR, signaling is impaired. The lack of LIFR signaling disrupts normal bone formation, leading to osteopenia, bowed legs, and other skeletal problems common in Stve Wiedemann syndrome. In addition, development of nerve cells, particularly those involved in the autonomic nervous system, is abnormal, leading to the problems with breathing, feeding, and regulating body temperature characteristic of this condition. A small number of people with Stve Wiedemann syndrome do not have an identified mutation in the LIFR gene. Researchers suggest that other genes that have not been identified may be involved in this condition.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mutations in the FLNB gene cause spondylocarpotarsal synostosis syndrome. The FLNB gene provides instructions for making a protein called filamin B. This protein helps build the network of protein filaments cytoskeleton that gives structure to cells and allows them to change shape and move. Filamin B attaches binds to another protein called actin and helps the actin to form the branching network of filaments that makes up the cytoskeleton. It also links actin to many other proteins to perform various functions within the cell, including the cell signaling that helps determine how the cytoskeleton will change as tissues grow and take shape during development. Filamin B is especially important in the development of the skeleton before birth. It is active expressed in the cell membranes of cartilage forming cells chondrocytes . Cartilage is a tough, flexible tissue that makes up much of the skeleton during early development. Most cartilage is later converted to bone a process called ossification , except for the cartilage that continues to cover and protect the ends of bones and is present in the nose, airways trachea and bronchi , and external ears. Filamin B appears to be important for normal cell growth and division proliferation and maturation differentiation of chondrocytes and for the ossification of cartilage. FLNB gene mutations that cause spondylocarpotarsal synostosis syndrome result in the production of an abnormally short filamin B protein that is unstable and breaks down rapidly. Loss of the filamin B protein appears to result in out of place ectopic ossification, resulting in fusion of the bones in the spine, wrists, and ankles and other signs and symptoms of spondylocarpotarsal synostosis syndrome. A few individuals who have been diagnosed with spondylocarpotarsal synostosis syndrome do not have mutations in the FLNB gene. In these cases, the genetic cause of the disorder is unknown.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Triple A syndrome is an inherited condition characterized by three specific features achalasia, Addison disease, and alacrima. Achalasia is a disorder that affects the ability to move food through the esophagus, the tube that carries food from the throat to the stomach. It can lead to severe feeding difficulties and low blood sugar hypoglycemia . Addison disease, also known as primary adrenal insufficiency, is caused by abnormal function of the small hormone producing glands on top of each kidney adrenal glands . The main features of Addison disease include fatigue, loss of appetite, weight loss, low blood pressure, and darkening of the skin. The third major feature of triple A syndrome is a reduced or absent ability to secrete tears alacrima . Most people with triple A syndrome have all three of these features, although some have only two. Many of the features of triple A syndrome are caused by dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system. This part of the nervous system controls involuntary body processes such as digestion, blood pressure, and body temperature. People with triple A syndrome often experience abnormal sweating, difficulty regulating blood pressure, unequal pupil size anisocoria , and other signs and symptoms of autonomic nervous system dysfunction dysautonomia . People with this condition may have other neurological abnormalities, such as developmental delay, intellectual disability, speech problems dysarthria , and a small head size microcephaly . In addition, affected individuals commonly experience muscle weakness, movement problems, and nerve abnormalities in their extremities peripheral neuropathy . Some develop optic atrophy, which is the degeneration atrophy of the nerves that carry information from the eyes to the brain. Many of the neurological symptoms of triple A syndrome worsen over time. People with triple A syndrome frequently develop a thickening of the outer layer of skin hyperkeratosis on the palms of their hands and the soles of their feet. Other skin abnormalities may also be present in people with this condition. Alacrima is usually the first noticeable sign of triple A syndrome, as it becomes apparent early in life that affected children produce little or no tears while crying. They develop Addison disease and achalasia during childhood or adolescence, and most of the neurologic features of triple A syndrome begin during adulthood. The signs and symptoms of this condition vary among affected individuals, even among members of the same family.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mutations in the AAAS gene cause triple A syndrome. This gene provides instructions for making a protein called ALADIN whose function is not well understood. Within cells, ALADIN is found in the nuclear envelope, the structure that surrounds the nucleus and separates it from the rest of the cell. Based on its location, ALADIN is thought to be involved in the movement of molecules into and out of the nucleus. Mutations in the AAAS gene change the structure of ALADIN in different ways however, almost all mutations prevent this protein from reaching its proper location in the nuclear envelope. The absence of ALADIN in the nuclear envelope likely disrupts the movement of molecules across this membrane. Researchers suspect that DNA repair proteins may be unable to enter the nucleus if ALADIN is missing from the nuclear envelope. DNA damage that is not repaired can cause the cell to become unstable and lead to cell death. Although the nervous system is particularly vulnerable to DNA damage, it remains unknown exactly how mutations in the AAAS gene lead to the signs and symptoms of triple A syndrome. Some individuals with triple A syndrome do not have an identified mutation in the AAAS gene. The genetic cause of the disorder is unknown in these individuals.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Osteoglophonic dysplasia is a condition characterized by abnormal bone growth that leads to severe head and face craniofacial abnormalities, dwarfism, and other features. The term osteoglophonic refers to the bones osteo having distinctive hollowed out glophonic areas that appear as holes on x ray images. Premature fusion of certain bones in the skull craniosynostosis typically occurs in osteoglophonic dysplasia. The craniosynostosis associated with this disorder may give the head a tall appearance, often referred to in the medical literature as a tower shaped skull, or a relatively mild version of a deformity called a cloverleaf skull. Characteristic facial features in people with osteoglophonic dysplasia include a prominent forehead frontal bossing , widely spaced eyes hypertelorism , flattening of the bridge of the nose and of the middle of the face midface hypoplasia , a large tongue macroglossia , a protruding jaw prognathism , and a short neck. People with this condition usually have no visible teeth because the teeth never emerge from the jaw clinical anodontia . In addition, the gums are often overgrown hypertrophic gingiva . Infants with osteoglophonic dysplasia often experience failure to thrive, which means they do not gain weight and grow at the expected rate. Affected individuals have short, bowed legs and arms and are short in stature. They also have flat feet and short, broad hands and fingers. The life expectancy of people with osteoglophonic dysplasia depends on the extent of their craniofacial abnormalities those that obstruct the air passages and affect the mouth and teeth can lead to respiratory problems and cause difficulty with eating and drinking. Despite the skull abnormalities, intelligence is generally not affected in this disorder.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Osteoglophonic dysplasia is caused by mutations in the FGFR1 gene, which provides instructions for making a protein called fibroblast growth factor receptor 1. This protein is one of four fibroblast growth factor receptors, which are related proteins that bind attach to other proteins called fibroblast growth factors. The growth factors and their receptors are involved in important processes such as cell division, regulation of cell growth and maturation, formation of blood vessels, wound healing, and embryonic development. In particular, they play a major role in skeletal development. The FGFR1 protein spans the cell membrane, so that one end of the protein remains inside the cell and the other end projects from the outer surface of the cell. When a fibroblast growth factor binds to the part of the FGFR1 protein outside the cell, the receptor triggers a cascade of chemical reactions inside the cell that instruct the cell to undergo certain changes, such as maturing to take on specialized functions. The FGFR1 protein is thought to play an important role in the development of the nervous system. This protein may also help regulate the growth of long bones, such as the large bones in the arms and legs. FGFR1 gene mutations that cause osteoglophonic dysplasia change single building blocks amino acids in the FGFR1 protein. The altered FGFR1 protein appears to cause prolonged signaling, which promotes premature fusion of bones in the skull and disrupts the regulation of bone growth in the arms and legs.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura is a rare disorder that causes blood clots thrombi to form in small blood vessels throughout the body. These clots can cause serious medical problems if they block vessels and restrict blood flow to organs such as the brain, kidneys, and heart. Resulting complications can include neurological problems such as personality changes, headaches, confusion, and slurred speech , fever, abnormal kidney function, abdominal pain, and heart problems. Blood clots normally form to prevent excess blood loss at the site of an injury. In people with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, clots develop in blood vessels even in the absence of injury. Blood clots are formed from clumps of cell fragments called platelets, which circulate in the blood and assist with clotting. Because a large number of platelets are used to make clots in people with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, fewer platelets are available in the bloodstream. A reduced level of circulating platelets is known as thrombocytopenia. Thrombocytopenia can lead to small areas of bleeding just under the surface of the skin, resulting in purplish spots called purpura. This disorder also causes red blood cells to break down undergo hemolysis prematurely. As blood squeezes past clots within blood vessels, red blood cells can break apart. A condition called hemolytic anemia occurs when red blood cells are destroyed faster than the body can replace them. This type of anemia leads to paleness, yellowing of the eyes and skin jaundice , fatigue, shortness of breath, and a rapid heart rate. There are two major forms of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, an acquired noninherited form and a familial form. The acquired form usually appears in late childhood or adulthood. Affected individuals may have a single episode of signs and symptoms, or they may recur over time. The familial form of this disorder is much rarer and typically appears in infancy or early childhood. In people with the familial form, signs and symptoms often recur on a regular basis.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mutations in the ADAMTS13 gene cause the familial form of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. The ADAMTS13 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme that is involved in the normal process of blood clotting. Mutations in this gene lead to a severe reduction in the activity of this enzyme. The acquired form of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura also results from a reduction in ADAMTS13 enzyme activity however, people with the acquired form do not have mutations in the ADAMTS13 gene. Instead, their immune systems often produce specific proteins called autoantibodies that block the activity of the enzyme. A lack of ADAMTS13 enzyme activity disrupts the usual balance between bleeding and clotting. Normally, blood clots form at the site of an injury to seal off damaged blood vessels and prevent excess blood loss. In people with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, clots form throughout the body as platelets bind together abnormally and stick to the walls of blood vessels. These clots can block small blood vessels, causing organ damage and the other features of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Researchers believe that other genetic or environmental factors may contribute to the signs and symptoms of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. In people with reduced ADAMTS13 enzyme activity, factors such as pregnancy, surgery, and infection may trigger abnormal blood clotting and its associated complications.',\n",

The most common feature of this condition is recurrent kidney stones urinary tract stones are also a frequent symptom. Kidney and urinary tract stones can create blockages in the urinary tract, causing pain during urination and difficulty releasing urine. Affected individuals can develop features of this condition anytime from infancy to late adulthood. When the condition appears in infancy, the first sign is usually the presence of tiny grains of reddish brown material in the baby s diaper caused by the passing of stones. Later, recurrent kidney and urinary tract stones can lead to problems with kidney function beginning as early as mid to late childhood. Approximately half of individuals with APRT deficiency first experience signs and symptoms of the condition in adulthood. The first features in affected adults are usually kidney stones and related urinary problems. Other signs and symptoms of APRT deficiency caused by kidney and urinary tract stones include fever, urinary tract infection, blood in the urine hematuria , abdominal cramps, nausea, and vomiting. Without treatment, kidney function can decline, which may lead to end stage renal disease ESRD . ESRD is a life threatening failure of kidney function that occurs when the kidneys are no longer able to filter fluids and waste products from the body effectively. The features of this condition and their severity vary greatly among affected individuals, even among members of the same family.

       "  'answer': 'Mutations in the APRT gene cause APRT deficiency. This gene provides instructions for making APRT, an enzyme that helps to convert a DNA building block nucleotide called adenine to a molecule called adenosine monophosphate AMP . This conversion occurs when AMP is needed as a source of energy for cells. APRT gene mutations lead to the production of an abnormal APRT enzyme with reduced function or prevent the production of any enzyme. A lack of functional enzyme impairs the conversion of adenine to AMP. As a result, adenine is converted to another molecule called 2,8 dihydroxyadenine 2,8 DHA . 2,8 DHA crystallizes in urine, forming stones in the kidneys and urinary tract. 2,8 DHA crystals are brownish in color, which explains why affected infants frequently have dark urine stains in their diapers. 2,8 DHA is toxic to kidneys, which may explain the possible decline in kidney function and the progression to ESRD.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Pantothenate kinase associated neurodegeneration formerly called Hallervorden Spatz syndrome is a disorder of the nervous system. This condition is characterized by progressive difficulty with movement, typically beginning in childhood. Movement abnormalities include involuntary muscle spasms, rigidity, and trouble with walking that worsens over time. Many people with this condition also develop problems with speech dysarthria , and some develop vision loss. Additionally, affected individuals may experience a loss of intellectual function dementia and psychiatric symptoms such as behavioral problems, personality changes, and depression. Pantothenate kinase associated neurodegeneration is characterized by an abnormal buildup of iron in certain areas of the brain. A particular change called the eye of the tiger sign, which indicates an accumulation of iron, is typically seen on magnetic resonance imaging MRI scans of the brain in people with this disorder. Researchers have described classic and atypical forms of pantothenate kinase associated neurodegeneration. The classic form usually appears in early childhood, causing severe problems with movement that worsen rapidly. Features of the atypical form appear later in childhood or adolescence and progress more slowly. Signs and symptoms vary, but the atypical form is more likely than the classic form to involve speech defects and psychiatric problems. A condition called HARP hypoprebetalipoproteinemia, acanthocytosis, retinitis pigmentosa, and pallidal degeneration , which was historically described as a separate syndrome, is now considered part of pantothenate kinase associated neurodegeneration. Although HARP is much rarer than classic pantothenate kinase associated neurodegeneration, both conditions involve problems with movement, dementia, and vision abnormalities.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mutations in the PANK2 gene cause pantothenate kinase associated neurodegeneration. The PANK2 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called pantothenate kinase 2. This enzyme is active in mitochondria, the energy producing centers within cells, where it plays a critical role in the formation of a molecule called coenzyme A. Found in all living cells, coenzyme A is essential for the body s production of energy from carbohydrates, fats, and some protein building blocks amino acids . Mutations in the PANK2 gene likely result in the production of an abnormal version of pantothenate kinase 2 or prevent cells from making any of this enzyme. A lack of functional pantothenate kinase 2 disrupts the production of coenzyme A and allows potentially harmful compounds to build up in the brain. This buildup leads to swelling and tissue damage, and allows iron to accumulate abnormally in certain parts of the brain. Researchers have not determined how these changes result in the specific features of pantothenate kinase associated neurodegeneration. Because pantothenate kinase 2 functions in mitochondria, the signs and symptoms of this condition may be related to impaired energy production.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Ovarian cancer is a disease that affects women. In this form of cancer, certain cells in the ovary become abnormal and multiply uncontrollably to form a tumor. The ovaries are the female reproductive organs in which egg cells are produced. In about 90 percent of cases, ovarian cancer occurs after age 40, and most cases occur after age 60. The most common form of ovarian cancer begins in epithelial cells, which are the cells that line the surfaces and cavities of the body. These cancers can arise in the epithelial cells on the surface of the ovary. However, researchers suggest that many or even most ovarian cancers begin in epithelial cells on the fringes fimbriae at the end of one of the fallopian tubes, and the cancerous cells migrate to the ovary. Cancer can also begin in epithelial cells that form the lining of the abdomen the peritoneum . This form of cancer, called primary peritoneal cancer, resembles epithelial ovarian cancer in its origin, symptoms, progression, and treatment. Primary peritoneal cancer often spreads to the ovaries. It can also occur even if the ovaries have been removed. Because cancers that begin in the ovaries, fallopian tubes, and peritoneum are so similar and spread easily from one of these structures to the others, they are often difficult to distinguish. These cancers are so closely related that they are generally considered collectively by experts. In about 10 percent of cases, ovarian cancer develops not in epithelial cells but in germ cells, which are precursors to egg cells, or in hormone producing ovarian cells called granulosa cells. In its early stages, ovarian cancer usually does not cause noticeable symptoms. As the cancer progresses, signs and symptoms can include pain or a feeling of heaviness in the pelvis or lower abdomen, bloating, feeling full quickly when eating, back pain, vaginal bleeding between menstrual periods or after menopause, or changes in urinary or bowel habits. However, these changes can occur as part of many different conditions. Having one or more of these symptoms does not mean that a woman has ovarian cancer. In some cases, cancerous tumors can invade surrounding tissue and spread to other parts of the body. If ovarian cancer spreads, cancerous tumors most often appear in the abdominal cavity or on the surfaces of nearby organs such as the bladder or colon. Tumors that begin at one site and then spread to other areas of the body are called metastatic cancers. Some ovarian cancers cluster in families. These cancers are described as hereditary and are associated with inherited gene mutations. Hereditary ovarian cancers tend to develop earlier in life than non inherited sporadic cases. Because it is often diagnosed at a late stage, ovarian cancer can be difficult to treat it leads to the deaths of about 140,000 women annually, more than any other gynecological cancer. However, when it is diagnosed and treated early, the 5 year survival rate is high.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Cancers occur when a buildup of mutations in critical genesthose that control cell growth and division or repair damaged DNAallow cells to grow and divide uncontrollably to form a tumor. Most cases of ovarian cancer are sporadic in these cases the associated genetic changes are acquired during a person s lifetime and are present only in certain cells in the ovary. These changes, which are called somatic mutations, are not inherited. Somatic mutations in the TP53 gene occur in almost half of all ovarian cancers. The protein produced from this gene is described as a tumor suppressor because it helps keep cells from growing and dividing too fast or in an uncontrolled way. Most of these mutations change single protein building blocks amino acids in the p53 protein, which reduces or eliminates the protein s tumor suppressor function. Because the altered protein is less able to regulate cell growth and division, a cancerous tumor may develop. Somatic mutations in many other genes have also been found in ovarian cancer cells. In hereditary ovarian cancer, the associated genetic changes are passed down within a family. These changes, classified as germline mutations, are present in all the body s cells. In people with germline mutations, other inherited and somatic gene changes, together with environmental and lifestyle factors, also influence whether a woman will develop ovarian cancer. Germline mutations are involved in more than one fifth of ovarian cancer cases. Between 65 and 85 percent of these mutations are in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene. These gene mutations are described as high penetrance because they are associated with a high risk of developing ovarian cancer, breast cancer, and several other types of cancer in women. Compared to a 1.6 percent lifetime risk of developing ovarian cancer for women in the total population, the lifetime risk in women with a BRCA1 gene mutation is 40 to 60 percent, and the lifetime risk in women with a BRCA2 gene mutation is 20 to 35 percent. Men with mutations in these genes also have an increased risk of developing several forms of cancer. The proteins produced from the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are tumor suppressors that are involved in fixing damaged DNA, which helps to maintain the stability of a cell s genetic information. Mutations in these genes impair DNA repair, allowing potentially damaging mutations to persist in DNA. As these defects accumulate, they can trigger cells to grow and divide without control or order to form a tumor. A significantly increased risk of ovarian cancer is also a feature of certain rare genetic syndromes, including a disorder called Lynch syndrome. Lynch syndrome is most often associated with mutations in the MLH1 or MSH2 gene and accounts for between 10 and 15 percent of hereditary ovarian cancers. Other rare genetic syndromes may also be associated with an increased risk of ovarian cancer. The proteins produced from the genes associated with these syndromes act as tumor suppressors. Mutations in any of these genes can allow cells to grow and divide unchecked, leading to the development of a cancerous tumor. Like BRCA1 and BRCA2, these genes are considered high penetrance because mutations greatly increase a person s chance of developing cancer. In addition to ovarian cancer, mutations in these genes increase the risk of several other types of cancer in both men and women. Germline mutations in dozens of other genes have been studied as possible risk factors for ovarian cancer. These genes are described as low penetrance or moderate penetrance because changes in each of these genes appear to make only a small or moderate contribution to overall ovarian cancer risk. Some of these genes provide instructions for making proteins that interact with the proteins produced from the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes. Others act through different pathways. Researchers suspect that the combined influence of variations in these genes may significantly impact a person s risk of developing ovarian cancer. In many families, the genetic changes associated with hereditary ovarian cancer are unknown. Identifying additional genetic risk factors for ovarian cancer is an active area of medical research. In addition to genetic changes, researchers have identified many personal and environmental factors that contribute to a woman s risk of developing ovarian cancer. These factors include age, ethnic background, and hormonal and reproductive factors. A history of ovarian cancer in closely related family members is also an important risk factor, particularly if the cancer occurred in early adulthood.',\n",

These cancers are associated with somatic mutations that are acquired during a person s lifetime, and they do not cluster in families. A predisposition to cancer caused by a germline mutation is usually inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to increase a person s chance of developing cancer. Although ovarian cancer occurs only in women, the mutated gene can be inherited from either the mother or the father. It is important to note that people inherit an increased likelihood of developing cancer, not the disease itself. Not all people who inherit mutations in these genes will ultimately develop cancer. In many cases of ovarian cancer that clusters in families, the genetic basis for the disease and the mechanism of inheritance are unclear.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'An abdominal wall defect is an opening in the abdomen through which various abdominal organs can protrude. This opening varies in size and can usually be diagnosed early in fetal development, typically between the tenth and fourteenth weeks of pregnancy. There are two main types of abdominal wall defects omphalocele and gastroschisis. Omphalocele is an opening in the center of the abdominal wall where the umbilical cord meets the abdomen. Organs typically the intestines, stomach, and liver protrude through the opening into the umbilical cord and are covered by the same protective membrane that covers the umbilical cord. Gastroschisis is a defect in the abdominal wall, usually to the right of the umbilical cord, through which the large and small intestines protrude although other organs may sometimes bulge out . There is no membrane covering the exposed organs in gastroschisis. Fetuses with omphalocele may grow slowly before birth intrauterine growth retardation and they may be born prematurely. Individuals with omphalocele frequently have multiple birth defects, such as a congenital heart defect. Additionally, underdevelopment of the lungs is often associated with omphalocele because the abdominal organs normally provide a framework for chest wall growth. When those organs are misplaced, the chest wall does not form properly, providing a smaller than normal space for the lungs to develop. As a result, many infants with omphalocele have respiratory insufficiency and may need to be supported with a machine to help them breathe mechanical ventilation . Rarely, affected individuals who have breathing problems in infancy experience recurrent lung infections or asthma later in life. Affected infants often have gastrointestinal problems including a backflow of stomach acids into the esophagus gastroesophageal reflux and feeding difficulty these problems can persist even after treatment of omphalocele. Large omphaloceles or those associated with multiple additional health problems are more often associated with fetal death than cases in which omphalocele occurs alone isolated . Omphalocele is a feature of many genetic syndromes. Nearly half of individuals with omphalocele have a condition caused by an extra copy of one of the chromosomes in each of their cells trisomy . Up to one third of people born with omphalocele have a genetic condition called Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome. Affected individuals may have additional signs and symptoms associated with these genetic conditions. Individuals who have gastroschisis rarely have other birth defects and seldom have chromosome abnormalities or a genetic condition. Most affected individuals experience intrauterine growth retardation and are small at birth many affected infants are born prematurely. With gastroschisis, the protruding organs are not covered by a protective membrane and are susceptible to damage due to direct contact with amniotic fluid in the womb. Components of the amniotic fluid may trigger immune responses and inflammatory reactions against the intestines that can damage the tissue. Constriction around exposed organs at the abdominal wall opening late in fetal development may also contribute to organ injury. Intestinal damage causes impairment of the muscle contractions that move food through the digestive tract peristalsis in most children with gastroschisis. In these individuals, peristalsis usually improves in a few months and intestinal muscle contractions normalize. Rarely, children with gastroschisis have a narrowing or absence of a portion of intestine intestinal atresia or twisting of the intestine. After birth, these intestinal malformations can lead to problems with digestive function, further loss of intestinal tissue, and a condition called short bowel syndrome that occurs when areas of the small intestine are missing, causing dehydration and poor absorption of nutrients. Depending on the severity of the condition, intravenous feedings parenteral nutrition may be required. The health of an individual with gastroschisis depends largely on how damaged his or her intestine was before birth. When the abdominal wall defect is repaired and normal intestinal function is recovered, the vast majority of affected individuals have no health problems related to the repaired defect later in life.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'No genetic mutations are known to cause an abdominal wall defect. Multiple genetic and environmental factors likely influence the development of this disorder. Omphalocele and gastroschisis are caused by different errors in fetal development. Omphalocele occurs during an error in digestive tract development. During the formation of the abdominal cavity in the sixth to tenth weeks of fetal development, the intestines normally protrude into the umbilical cord but recede back into the abdomen as development continues. Omphalocele occurs when the intestines do not recede back into the abdomen, but remain in the umbilical cord. Other abdominal organs can also protrude through this opening, resulting in the varied organ involvement that occurs in omphalocele. The error that leads to gastroschisis formation is unknown. It is thought to be either a disruption in the blood flow to the digestive tract or a lack of development or injury to gastrointestinal tissue early in fetal development. For reasons that are unknown, women under the age of 20 are at the greatest risk of having a baby with gastroschisis. Other risk factors in pregnancy may include taking medications that constrict the blood vessels called vasoconstrictive drugs or smoking, although these risk factors have not been confirmed.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Primary myelofibrosis is a condition characterized by the buildup of scar tissue fibrosis in the bone marrow, the tissue that produces blood cells. Because of the fibrosis, the bone marrow is unable to make enough normal blood cells. The shortage of blood cells causes many of the signs and symptoms of primary myelofibrosis. Initially, most people with primary myelofibrosis have no signs or symptoms. Eventually, fibrosis can lead to a reduction in the number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. A shortage of red blood cells anemia often causes extreme tiredness fatigue or shortness of breath. A loss of white blood cells can lead to an increased number of infections, and a reduction of platelets can cause easy bleeding or bruising. Because blood cell formation hematopoiesis in the bone marrow is disrupted, other organs such as the spleen or liver may begin to produce blood cells. This process, called extramedullary hematopoiesis, often leads to an enlarged spleen splenomegaly or an enlarged liver hepatomegaly . People with splenomegaly may feel pain or fullness in the abdomen, especially below the ribs on the left side. Other common signs and symptoms of primary myelofibrosis include fever, night sweats, and bone pain. Primary myelofibrosis is most commonly diagnosed in people aged 50 to 80 but can occur at any age.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mutations in the JAK2, MPL, CALR, and TET2 genes are associated with most cases of primary myelofibrosis. The JAK2 and MPL genes provide instructions for making proteins that promote the growth and division proliferation of blood cells. The CALR gene provides instructions for making a protein with multiple functions, including ensuring the proper folding of newly formed proteins and maintaining the correct levels of stored calcium in cells. The TET2 gene provides instructions for making a protein whose function is unknown. The proteins produced from the JAK2 and MPL genes are both part of a signaling pathway called the JAK STAT pathway, which transmits chemical signals from outside the cell to the cell s nucleus. The protein produced from the MPL gene, called thrombopoietin receptor, turns on activates the pathway, and the JAK2 protein transmits signals after activation. Through the JAK STAT pathway, these two proteins promote the proliferation of blood cells, particularly a type of blood cell known as a megakaryocyte. Mutations in either the JAK2 gene or the MPL gene that are associated with primary myelofibrosis lead to overactivation of the JAK STAT pathway. The abnormal activation of JAK STAT signaling leads to overproduction of abnormal megakaryocytes, and these megakaryocytes stimulate another type of cell to release collagen. Collagen is a protein that normally provides structural support for the cells in the bone marrow. However, in primary myelofibrosis, the excess collagen forms scar tissue in the bone marrow. Although mutations in the CALR gene and the TET2 gene are relatively common in primary myelofibrosis, it is unclear how these mutations are involved in the development of the condition. Some people with primary myelofibrosis do not have a mutation in any of the known genes associated with this condition. Researchers are working to identify other genes that may be involved in the condition.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Protein C deficiency is a disorder that increases the risk of developing abnormal blood clots the condition can be mild or severe. Individuals with mild protein C deficiency are at risk of a type of blood clot known as a deep vein thrombosis DVT . These clots occur in the deep veins of the arms or legs, away from the surface of the skin. A DVT can travel through the bloodstream and lodge in the lungs, causing a life threatening blockage of blood flow known as a pulmonary embolism PE . While most people with mild protein C deficiency never develop abnormal blood clots, certain factors can add to the risk of their development. These factors include increased age, surgery, inactivity, or pregnancy. Having another inherited disorder of blood clotting in addition to protein C deficiency can also influence the risk of abnormal blood clotting. In severe cases of protein C deficiency, infants develop a life threatening blood clotting disorder called purpura fulminans soon after birth. Purpura fulminans is characterized by the formation of blood clots in the small blood vessels throughout the body. These blood clots block normal blood flow and can lead to localized death of body tissue necrosis . Widespread blood clotting uses up all available blood clotting proteins. As a result, abnormal bleeding occurs in various parts of the body, which can cause large, purple patches on the skin. Individuals who survive the newborn period may experience recurrent episodes of purpura fulminans.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Protein C deficiency is caused by mutations in the PROC gene. This gene provides instructions for making protein C, which is found in the bloodstream and is important for controlling blood clotting. Protein C blocks the activity of inactivates certain proteins that promote blood clotting. Most of the mutations that cause protein C deficiency change single protein building blocks amino acids in protein C, which disrupts its ability to control blood clotting. Individuals with this condition do not have enough functional protein C to inactivate clotting proteins, which results in the increased risk of developing abnormal blood clots. Protein C deficiency can be divided into type I and type II based on how mutations in the PROC gene affect protein C. Type I is caused by PROC gene mutations that result in reduced levels of protein C, while type II is caused by PROC gene mutations that result in the production of an altered protein C with reduced activity. Both types of mutations can be associated with mild or severe protein C deficiency the severity is determined by the number of PROC gene mutations an individual has.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Citrullinemia is an inherited disorder that causes ammonia and other toxic substances to accumulate in the blood. Two forms of citrullinemia have been described they have different signs and symptoms and are caused by mutations in different genes. Type I citrullinemia also known as classic citrullinemia usually becomes evident in the first few days of life. Affected infants typically appear normal at birth, but as ammonia builds up in the body they experience a progressive lack of energy lethargy , poor feeding, vomiting, seizures, and loss of consciousness. These medical problems are life threatening in many cases. Less commonly, a milder form of type I citrullinemia can develop later in childhood or adulthood. This later onset form is associated with intense headaches, partial loss of vision, problems with balance and muscle coordination ataxia , and lethargy. Some people with gene mutations that cause type I citrullinemia never experience signs and symptoms of the disorder. Type II citrullinemia chiefly affects the nervous system, causing confusion, restlessness, memory loss, abnormal behaviors such as aggression, irritability, and hyperactivity , seizures, and coma. In some cases, the signs and symptoms of this disorder appear during adulthood adult onset . These signs and symptoms can be life threatening, and are known to be triggered by certain medications, infections, surgery, and alcohol intake in people with adult onset type II citrullinemia. The features of adult onset type II citrullinemia may also develop in people who as infants had a liver disorder called neonatal intrahepatic cholestasis caused by citrin deficiency NICCD . This liver condition is also known as neonatal onset type II citrullinemia. NICCD blocks the flow of bile a digestive fluid produced by the liver and prevents the body from processing certain nutrients properly. In many cases, the signs and symptoms of NICCD resolve within a year. Years or even decades later, however, some of these people develop the characteristic features of adult onset type II citrullinemia.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mutations in the ASS1 and SLC25A13 genes cause citrullinemia. Citrullinemia belongs to a class of genetic diseases called urea cycle disorders. The urea cycle is a sequence of chemical reactions that takes place in liver cells. These reactions process excess nitrogen that is generated when protein is used by the body. The excess nitrogen is used to make a compound called urea, which is excreted in urine. Mutations in the ASS1 gene cause type I citrullinemia. This gene provides instructions for making an enzyme, argininosuccinate synthase 1, that is responsible for one step of the urea cycle. Mutations in the ASS1 gene reduce the activity of the enzyme, which disrupts the urea cycle and prevents the body from processing nitrogen effectively. Excess nitrogen in the form of ammonia and other byproducts of the urea cycle accumulate in the bloodstream. Ammonia is particularly toxic to the nervous system, which helps explain the neurologic symptoms such as lethargy, seizures, and ataxia that are often seen in type I citrullinemia. Mutations in the SLC25A13 gene are responsible for adult onset type II citrullinemia and NICCD. This gene provides instructions for making a protein called citrin. Within cells, citrin helps transport molecules used in the production and breakdown of simple sugars, the production of proteins, and the urea cycle. Molecules transported by citrin are also involved in making nucleotides, which are the building blocks of DNA and its chemical cousin, RNA. Mutations in the SLC25A13 gene typically prevent cells from making any functional citrin, which inhibits the urea cycle and disrupts the production of proteins and nucleotides. The resulting buildup of ammonia and other toxic substances leads to the signs and symptoms of adult onset type II citrullinemia. A lack of citrin also leads to the features of NICCD, although ammonia does not build up in the bloodstream of infants with this condition.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Medullary cystic kidney disease type 1 MCKD1 is an inherited condition that affects the kidneys. It leads to scarring fibrosis and impaired function of the kidneys, usually beginning in adulthood. The kidneys filter fluid and waste products from the body. They also reabsorb needed nutrients and release them back into the blood. As MCKD1 progresses, the kidneys are less able to function, resulting in kidney failure. Declining kidney function in people with MCKD1 leads to the signs and symptoms of the condition. The features are variable, even among members of the same family. Many individuals with MCKD1 develop high blood pressure hypertension , especially as kidney function worsens. Some develop high levels of a waste product called uric acid in the blood hyperuricemia because the damaged kidneys are unable to remove uric acid effectively. In a small number of affected individuals, the buildup of this waste product can cause gout, which is a form of arthritis resulting from uric acid crystals in the joints. Although the condition is named medullary cystic kidney disease, only about 40 percent of affected individuals have medullary cysts, which are fluid filled pockets found in a particular region of the kidney. When present, the cysts are usually found in the inner part of the kidney the medullary region or the border between the inner and outer parts corticomedullary region .

       "  'answer': 'MCKD1 is caused by mutations in the MUC1 gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein called mucin 1, which is one of several mucin proteins that make up mucus. Mucus is a slippery substance that lubricates the lining of the airways, digestive system, reproductive system, and other organs and tissues and protects them from foreign invaders and other particles. In addition to its role in mucus, mucin 1 relays signals from outside the cell to the cell s nucleus. Through this cellular signaling, mucin 1 is thought to be involved in the growth, movement, and survival of cells. Research suggests that mucin 1 plays a role in the normal development of the kidneys. MCKD1 is caused by the insertion of a single DNA building block nucleotide called cytosine into the MUC1 gene.

       "  'answer': 'CAV3 related distal myopathy is part of a group of conditions called caveolinopathies, which are muscle disorders caused by mutations in the CAV3 gene. The CAV3 gene provides instructions for making a protein called caveolin 3, which is found in the membrane surrounding muscle cells. This protein is the main component of caveolae, which are small pouches in the muscle cell membrane. Within the caveolae, the caveolin 3 protein acts as a scaffold to organize other molecules that are important for cell signaling and maintenance of the cell structure. CAV3 gene mutations result in a shortage of caveolin 3 protein in the muscle cell membrane and a reduction in the number of caveolae. Researchers suggest that a shortage of caveolae impairs the structural integrity of muscle cells, interferes with cell signaling, and causes the self destruction of cells apoptosis . The resulting degeneration of muscle tissue leads to the signs and symptoms of CAV3 related distal myopathy. In addition to CAV3 related distal myopathy, CAV3 gene mutations can cause other caveolinopathies including limb girdle muscular dystrophy, rippling muscle disease, isolated hyperCKemia, and a heart disorder called hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Several CAV3 gene mutations have been found to cause different caveolinopathies in different individuals.

       "  'answer': 'Loeys Dietz syndrome is a disorder that affects the connective tissue in many parts of the body. Connective tissue provides strength and flexibility to structures such as bones, ligaments, muscles, and blood vessels. There are four types of Loeys Dietz syndrome, labelled types I through IV, which are distinguished by their genetic cause. Regardless of the type, signs and symptoms of Loeys Dietz syndrome can become apparent anytime in childhood or adulthood, and the severity is variable. Loeys Dietz syndrome is characterized by enlargement of the aorta, which is the large blood vessel that distributes blood from the heart to the rest of the body. The aorta can weaken and stretch, causing a bulge in the blood vessel wall an aneurysm . Stretching of the aorta may also lead to a sudden tearing of the layers in the aorta wall aortic dissection . People with Loeys Dietz syndrome can also have aneurysms or dissections in arteries throughout the body and have arteries with abnormal twists and turns arterial tortuosity . Individuals with Loeys Dietz syndrome often have skeletal problems including premature fusion of the skull bones craniosynostosis , an abnormal side to side curvature of the spine scoliosis , either a sunken chest pectus excavatum or a protruding chest pectus carinatum , an inward and upward turning foot clubfoot , flat feet pes planus , or elongated limbs with joint deformities called contractures that restrict the movement of certain joints. Degeneration of the discs that separate the bones of the spine vertebrae , often affecting the neck, is a common finding. Some affected individuals have prominent joint inflammation osteoarthritis that commonly affects the knees and the joints of the hands, wrists, and spine. People with Loeys Dietz syndrome may bruise easily and develop abnormal scars after wound healing. The skin is frequently described as translucent, often with stretch marks striae and visible underlying veins. Other characteristic features include widely spaced eyes hypertelorism , a split in the soft flap of tissue that hangs from the back of the mouth bifid uvula , and an opening in the roof of the mouth cleft palate . Individuals with Loeys Dietz syndrome frequently develop immune system related problems such as food allergies, asthma, or inflammatory disorders such as eczema or inflammatory bowel disease.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'The four types of Loeys Dietz syndrome are distinguished by their genetic cause mutations in the TGFBR1 gene cause type I, mutations in the TGFBR2 gene cause type II, mutations in the SMAD3 gene cause type III, and mutations in the TGFB2 gene cause type IV. These four genes play a role in cell signaling that promotes growth and development of the body s tissues. This signaling pathway also helps with bone and blood vessel development and plays a part in the formation of the extracellular matrix, an intricate lattice of proteins and other molecules that forms in the spaces between cells. Mutations in the TGFBR1, TGFBR2, TGFB2, and SMAD3 genes result in the production of proteins with little or no function. Even though these proteins have severely reduced function, cell signaling occurs at an even greater intensity than normal. Researchers speculate that the activity of proteins in this signaling pathway is increased to compensate for the protein whose function is reduced however, the exact mechanism responsible for the increase in signaling is unclear. The overactive signaling pathway disrupts the development of connective tissue, the extracellular matrix, and various body systems, leading to the varied signs and symptoms of Loeys Dietz syndrome.',\n",

The lymphatic system produces and transports fluids and immune cells throughout the body. People with lymphedema distichiasis syndrome develop puffiness or swelling lymphedema of the limbs, typically the legs and feet. Another characteristic of this syndrome is the growth of extra eyelashes distichiasis , ranging from a few extra eyelashes to a full extra set on both the upper and lower lids. These eyelashes do not grow along the edge of the eyelid, but out of its inner lining. When the abnormal eyelashes touch the eyeball, they can cause damage to the clear covering of the eye cornea . Related eye problems can include an irregular curvature of the cornea causing blurred vision astigmatism or scarring of the cornea. Other health problems associated with this disorder include swollen and knotted varicose veins, droopy eyelids ptosis , heart abnormalities, and an opening in the roof of the mouth a cleft palate . All people with lymphedema distichiasis syndrome have extra eyelashes present at birth. The age of onset of lymphedema varies, but it most often begins during puberty.

       "  'answer': 'Cherubism is a disorder characterized by abnormal bone tissue in the lower part of the face. Beginning in early childhood, both the lower jaw the mandible and the upper jaw the maxilla become enlarged as bone is replaced with painless, cyst like growths. These growths give the cheeks a swollen, rounded appearance and often interfere with normal tooth development. In some people the condition is so mild that it may not be noticeable, while other cases are severe enough to cause problems with vision, breathing, speech, and swallowing. Enlargement of the jaw usually continues throughout childhood and stabilizes during puberty. The abnormal growths are gradually replaced with normal bone in early adulthood. As a result, many affected adults have a normal facial appearance. Most people with cherubism have few, if any, signs and symptoms affecting other parts of the body. Rarely, however, this condition occurs as part of another genetic disorder. For example, cherubism can occur with Ramon syndrome, which also involves short stature, intellectual disability, and overgrowth of the gums gingival fibrosis . Additionally, cherubism has been reported in rare cases of Noonan syndrome a developmental disorder characterized by unusual facial characteristics, short stature, and heart defects and fragile X syndrome a condition primarily affecting males that causes learning disabilities and cognitive impairment .',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mutations in the SH3BP2 gene have been identified in about 80 percent of people with cherubism. In most of the remaining cases, the genetic cause of the condition is unknown. The SH3BP2 gene provides instructions for making a protein whose exact function is unclear. The protein plays a role in transmitting chemical signals within cells, particularly cells involved in the replacement of old bone tissue with new bone bone remodeling and certain immune system cells. Mutations in the SH3BP2 gene lead to the production of an overly active version of this protein. The effects of SH3BP2 mutations are still under study, but researchers believe that the abnormal protein disrupts critical signaling pathways in cells associated with the maintenance of bone tissue and in some immune system cells. The overactive protein likely causes inflammation in the jaw bones and triggers the production of osteoclasts, which are cells that break down bone tissue during bone remodeling. An excess of these bone eating cells contributes to the destruction of bone in the upper and lower jaws. A combination of bone loss and inflammation likely underlies the cyst like growths characteristic of cherubism.',\n",

       "  'answer': '2 hydroxyglutaric aciduria is a condition that causes progressive damage to the brain. The major types of this disorder are called D 2 hydroxyglutaric aciduria D 2 HGA , L 2 hydroxyglutaric aciduria L 2 HGA , and combined D,L 2 hydroxyglutaric aciduria D,L 2 HGA . The main features of D 2 HGA are delayed development, seizures, weak muscle tone hypotonia , and abnormalities in the largest part of the brain the cerebrum , which controls many important functions such as muscle movement, speech, vision, thinking, emotion, and memory. Researchers have described two subtypes of D 2 HGA, type I and type II. The two subtypes are distinguished by their genetic cause and pattern of inheritance, although they also have some differences in signs and symptoms. Type II tends to begin earlier and often causes more severe health problems than type I. Type II may also be associated with a weakened and enlarged heart cardiomyopathy , a feature that is typically not found with type I. L 2 HGA particularly affects a region of the brain called the cerebellum, which is involved in coordinating movements. As a result, many affected individuals have problems with balance and muscle coordination ataxia . Additional features of L 2 HGA can include delayed development, seizures, speech difficulties, and an unusually large head macrocephaly . Typically, signs and symptoms of this disorder begin during infancy or early childhood. The disorder worsens over time, usually leading to severe disability by early adulthood. Combined D,L 2 HGA causes severe brain abnormalities that become apparent in early infancy. Affected infants have severe seizures, weak muscle tone hypotonia , and breathing and feeding problems.

       "  'answer': 'The different types of 2 hydroxyglutaric aciduria result from mutations in several genes. D 2 HGA type I is caused by mutations in the D2HGDH gene type II is caused by mutations in the IDH2 gene. L 2 HGA results from mutations in the L2HGDH gene. Combined D,L 2 HGA is caused by mutations in the SLC25A1 gene. The D2HGDH and L2HGDH genes provide instructions for making enzymes that are found in mitochondria, which are the energy producing centers within cells. The enzymes break down compounds called D 2 hydroxyglutarate and L 2 hydroxyglutarate, respectively, as part of a series of reactions that produce energy for cell activities. Mutations in either of these genes lead to a shortage of functional enzyme, which allows D 2 hydroxyglutarate or L 2 hydroxyglutarate to build up in cells. At high levels, these compounds can damage cells and lead to cell death. Brain cells appear to be the most vulnerable to the toxic effects of these compounds, which may explain why the signs and symptoms of D 2 HGA type I and L 2 HGA primarily involve the brain. The IDH2 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme in mitochondria that normally produces a different compound. When the enzyme is altered by mutations, it takes on a new, abnormal function production of the potentially toxic compound D 2 hydroxyglutarate. The resulting excess of this compound damages brain cells, leading to the signs and symptoms of D 2 HGA type II. It is unclear why an accumulation of D 2 hydroxyglutarate may be associated with cardiomyopathy in some people with this form of the condition. The SLC25A1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that transports certain molecules, such as citrate, in and out of mitochondria. Mutations in the SLC25A1 gene reduce the protein s function, which prevents it from carrying out this transport. Through processes that are not fully understood, a loss of this transport allows both D 2 hydroxyglutarate and L 2 hydroxyglutarate to build up, which damages brain cells. Researchers suspect that an imbalance of other molecules, particularly citrate, also contributes to the severe signs and symptoms of combined D,L 2 HGA.',\n",

They generally have small testes and may also have abnormalities such as undescended testes cryptorchidism or the urethra opening on the underside of the penis hypospadias . A small number of affected people have external genitalia that do not look clearly male or clearly female ambiguous genitalia . Affected children are typically raised as males and have a male gender identity. At puberty, most affected individuals require treatment with the male sex hormone testosterone to induce development of male secondary sex characteristics such as facial hair and deepening of the voice masculinization . Hormone treatment can also help prevent breast enlargement gynecomastia . Adults with this disorder are usually shorter than average for males and are unable to have children infertile .',\n",

       "  'answer': 'People normally have 46 chromosomes in each cell. Two of the 46 chromosomes, known as X and Y, are called sex chromosomes because they help determine whether a person will develop male or female sex characteristics. Females typically have two X chromosomes 46,XX , and males usually have one X chromosome and one Y chromosome 46,XY . The SRY gene, normally located on the Y chromosome, provides instructions for making the sex determining region Y protein. The sex determining region Y protein causes a fetus to develop as a male. In about 80 percent of individuals with 46,XX testicular disorder of sex development, the condition results from an abnormal exchange of genetic material between chromosomes translocation . This exchange occurs as a random event during the formation of sperm cells in the affected person s father. The translocation causes the SRY gene to be misplaced, almost always onto an X chromosome. If a fetus is conceived from a sperm cell with an X chromosome bearing the SRY gene, it will develop as a male despite not having a Y chromosome. This form of the condition is called SRY positive 46,XX testicular disorder of sex development. About 20 percent of people with 46,XX testicular disorder of sex development do not have the SRY gene. This form of the condition is called SRY negative 46,XX testicular disorder of sex development. The cause of the disorder in these individuals is unknown. They are more likely to have ambiguous genitalia than are people with the SRY positive form.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'SRY positive 46,XX testicular disorder of sex development is almost never inherited. This condition results from the translocation of a Y chromosome segment containing the SRY gene during the formation of sperm spermatogenesis . Affected people typically have no history of the disorder in their family and cannot pass on the disorder because they are infertile. In rare cases, the SRY gene may be misplaced onto a chromosome other than the X chromosome. This translocation may be carried by an unaffected father and passed on to a child with two X chromosomes, resulting in 46,XX testicular disorder of sex development. In another very rare situation, a man may carry the SRY gene on both the X and Y chromosome a child who inherits his X chromosome will develop male sex characteristics despite having no Y chromosome. The inheritance pattern of SRY negative 46,XX testicular disorder of sex development is unknown. A few families with unaffected parents have had more than one child with the condition, suggesting the possibility of autosomal recessive inheritance. Autosomal recessive means both copies of a gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Wolfram syndrome is a condition that affects many of the body s systems. The hallmark features of Wolfram syndrome are high blood sugar levels resulting from a shortage of the hormone insulin diabetes mellitus and progressive vision loss due to degeneration of the nerves that carry information from the eyes to the brain optic atrophy . People with Wolfram syndrome often also have pituitary gland dysfunction that results in the excretion of excessive amounts of urine diabetes insipidus , hearing loss caused by changes in the inner ear sensorineural deafness , urinary tract problems, reduced amounts of the sex hormone testosterone in males hypogonadism , or neurological or psychiatric disorders. Diabetes mellitus is typically the first symptom of Wolfram syndrome, usually diagnosed around age 6. Nearly everyone with Wolfram syndrome who develops diabetes mellitus requires insulin replacement therapy. Optic atrophy is often the next symptom to appear, usually around age 11. The first signs of optic atrophy are loss of color vision and side peripheral vision. Over time, the vision problems get worse, and people with optic atrophy are usually blind within approximately 8 years after signs of optic atrophy first begin. In diabetes insipidus, the pituitary gland, which is located at the base of the brain, does not function normally. This abnormality disrupts the release of a hormone called vasopressin, which helps control the body s water balance and urine production. Approximately 70 percent of people with Wolfram syndrome have diabetes insipidus. Pituitary gland dysfunction can also cause hypogonadism in males. The lack of testosterone that occurs with hypogonadism affects growth and sexual development. About 65 percent of people with Wolfram syndrome have sensorineural deafness that can range in severity from deafness beginning at birth to mild hearing loss beginning in adolescence that worsens over time. Sixty to 90 percent of people with Wolfram syndrome have a urinary tract problem. Urinary tract problems include obstruction of the ducts between the kidneys and bladder ureters , a large bladder that cannot empty normally high capacity atonal bladder , disrupted urination bladder sphincter dyssynergia , and difficulty controlling the flow of urine incontinence . About 60 percent of people with Wolfram syndrome develop a neurological or psychiatric disorder, most commonly problems with balance and coordination ataxia , typically beginning in early adulthood. Other neurological problems experienced by people with Wolfram syndrome include irregular breathing caused by the brain s inability to control breathing central apnea , loss of the sense of smell, loss of the gag reflex, muscle spasms myoclonus , seizures, reduced sensation in the lower extremities peripheral neuropathy , and intellectual impairment. Psychiatric disorders associated with Wolfram syndrome include psychosis, episodes of severe depression, and impulsive and aggressive behavior. There are two types of Wolfram syndrome with many overlapping features. The two types are differentiated by their genetic cause. In addition to the usual features of Wolfram syndrome, individuals with Wolfram syndrome type 2 have stomach or intestinal ulcers and excessive bleeding after an injury. The tendency to bleed excessively combined with the ulcers typically leads to abnormal bleeding in the gastrointestinal system. People with Wolfram syndrome type 2 do not develop diabetes insipidus. Wolfram syndrome is often fatal by mid adulthood due to complications from the many features of the condition, such as health problems related to diabetes mellitus or neurological problems.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mutations in the WFS1 gene cause more than 90 percent of Wolfram syndrome type 1 cases. This gene provides instructions for producing a protein called wolframin that is thought to regulate the amount of calcium in cells. A proper calcium balance is important for many different cellular functions, including cell to cell communication, the tensing contraction of muscles, and protein processing. The wolframin protein is found in many different tissues, such as the pancreas, brain, heart, bones, muscles, lung, liver, and kidneys. Within cells, wolframin is located in the membrane of a cell structure called the endoplasmic reticulum that is involved in protein production, processing, and transport. Wolframin s function is important in the pancreas, where the protein is thought to help process a protein called proinsulin into the mature hormone insulin. This hormone helps control blood sugar levels. WFS1 gene mutations lead to the production of a wolframin protein that has reduced or absent function. As a result, calcium levels within cells are not regulated and the endoplasmic reticulum does not work correctly. When the endoplasmic reticulum does not have enough functional wolframin, the cell triggers its own cell death apoptosis . The death of cells in the pancreas, specifically cells that make insulin beta cells , causes diabetes mellitus in people with Wolfram syndrome. The gradual loss of cells along the optic nerve eventually leads to blindness in affected individuals. The death of cells in other body systems likely causes the various signs and symptoms of Wolfram syndrome type 1. A certain mutation in the CISD2 gene was found to cause Wolfram syndrome type 2. The CISD2 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is located in the outer membrane of cell structures called mitochondria. Mitochondria are the energy producing centers of cells. The exact function of the CISD2 protein is unknown, but it is thought to help keep mitochondria functioning normally. The CISD2 gene mutation that causes Wolfram syndrome type 2 results in an abnormally small, nonfunctional CISD2 protein. As a result, mitochondria are not properly maintained, and they eventually break down. Since the mitochondria provide energy to cells, the loss of mitochondria results in decreased energy for cells. Cells that do not have enough energy to function will eventually die. Cells with high energy demands such as nerve cells in the brain, eye, or gastrointestinal tract are most susceptible to cell death due to reduced energy. It is unknown why people with CISD2 gene mutations have ulcers and bleeding problems in addition to the usual Wolfram syndrome features. Some people with Wolfram syndrome do not have an identified mutation in either the WFS1 or CISD2 gene. The cause of the condition in these individuals is unknown.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'X linked intellectual disability, Siderius type is caused by mutations in the PHF8 gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein that is found in the nucleus of cells, particularly in brain cells before and just after birth. The PHF8 protein attaches binds to complexes called chromatin to regulate the activity expression of other genes. Chromatin is the network of DNA and protein that packages DNA into chromosomes. Binding with the PHF8 protein is part of the process that changes the structure of chromatin chromatin remodeling to alter how tightly regions of DNA are packaged. Chromatin remodeling is one way gene expression is regulated when DNA is tightly packed, gene expression is often lower than when DNA is loosely packed. Most PHF8 gene mutations lead to an abnormally short protein that gets transported out of the cell s nucleus. Outside of the nucleus, the PHF8 protein cannot interact with chromatin to regulate gene expression. While the exact disease mechanism is unknown, it is likely that a lack of PHF8 protein in the nucleus of brain cells before birth prevents chromatin remodeling, altering the normal expression of genes involved in intellectual function and formation of structures along the midline of the skull. This altered gene expression leads to intellectual disability, cleft lip and palate, and the other features of X linked intellectual disability, Siderius type.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mutations in the FZD4, LRP5, and NDP genes can cause familial exudative vitreoretinopathy. These genes provide instructions for making proteins that participate in a chemical signaling pathway that affects the way cells and tissues develop. In particular, the proteins produced from the FZD4, LRP5, and NDP genes appear to play critical roles in the specialization of retinal cells and the establishment of a blood supply to the retina and the inner ear. The LRP5 protein also helps regulate bone formation. Mutations in the FZD4, LRP5, or NDP gene disrupt chemical signaling during early development, which interferes with the formation of blood vessels at the edges of the retina. The resulting abnormal blood supply to this tissue leads to retinal damage and vision loss in some people with familial exudative vitreoretinopathy. The eye abnormalities associated with familial exudative vitreoretinopathy tend to be similar no matter which gene is altered. However, affected individuals with LRP5 gene mutations often have reduced bone mineral density in addition to vision loss. Mutations in the other genes responsible for familial exudative vitreoretinopathy do not appear to affect bone density. In some cases, the cause of familial exudative vitreoretinopathy is unknown. Researchers believe that mutations in several as yet unidentified genes are responsible for the disorder in these cases.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Familial exudative vitreoretinopathy has different inheritance patterns depending on the gene involved. Most commonly, the condition results from mutations in the FZD4 or LRP5 gene and has an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. Autosomal dominant inheritance means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. Most people with autosomal dominant familial exudative vitreoretinopathy inherit the altered gene from a parent, although the parent may not have any signs and symptoms associated with this disorder. Familial exudative vitreoretinopathy caused by LRP5 gene mutations can also have an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. Autosomal recessive inheritance means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with autosomal recessive familial exudative vitreoretinopathy each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they do not have the disorder. When familial exudative vitreoretinopathy is caused by mutations in the NDP gene, it has an X linked recessive pattern of inheritance. The NDP gene is located on the X chromosome, which is one of the two sex chromosomes. In males who have only one X chromosome , one altered copy of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. In females who have two X chromosomes , a mutation would have to occur in both copies of the gene to cause the disorder. Because it is unlikely that females will have two altered copies of this gene, males are affected by X linked disorders much more frequently than females. A characteristic of X linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass X linked traits to their sons.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Giant congenital melanocytic nevus is a skin condition characterized by an abnormally dark, noncancerous skin patch nevus that is composed of pigment producing cells called melanocytes. It is present from birth congenital or is noticeable soon after birth. The nevus may be small in infants, but it will usually grow at the same rate the body grows and will eventually be at least 40 cm 15.75 inches across. The nevus can appear anywhere on the body, but it is more often found on the trunk or limbs. The color ranges from tan to black and can become darker or lighter over time. The surface of a nevus can be flat, rough, raised, thickened, or bumpy the surface can vary in different regions of the nevus, and it can change over time. The skin of the nevus is often dry and prone to irritation and itching dermatitis . Excessive hair growth hypertrichosis can occur within the nevus. There is often less fat tissue under the skin of the nevus the skin may appear thinner there than over other areas of the body. People with giant congenital melanocytic nevus may have more than one nevus plural nevi . The other nevi are often smaller than the giant nevus. Affected individuals may have one or two additional nevi or multiple small nevi that are scattered over the skin these are known as satellite or disseminated nevi. Affected individuals may feel anxiety or emotional stress due to the impact the nevus may have on their appearance and their health. Children with giant congenital melanocytic nevus can develop emotional or behavior problems. Some people with giant congenital melanocytic nevus develop a condition called neurocutaneous melanosis, which is the presence of pigment producing skin cells melanocytes in the tissue that covers the brain and spinal cord. These melanocytes may be spread out or grouped together in clusters. Their growth can cause increased pressure in the brain, leading to headache, vomiting, irritability, seizures, and movement problems. Tumors in the brain may also develop. Individuals with giant congenital melanocytic nevus have an increased risk of developing an aggressive form of cancer called melanoma, which arises from melanocytes. Estimates vary, but it is generally thought that people with giant congenital melanocytic nevus have a 5 to 10 percent lifetime risk of developing melanoma. Melanoma commonly begins in the nevus, but it can develop when melanocytes that invade other tissues, such as those in the brain and spinal cord, become cancerous. When melanoma occurs in people with giant congenital melanocytic nevus, the survival rate is low. Other types of tumors can also develop in individuals with giant congenital melanocytic nevus, including soft tissue tumors sarcomas , fatty tumors lipomas , and tumors of the nerve cells schwannomas .',\n",

       "  'answer': 'NRAS gene mutations cause most cases of giant congenital melanocytic nevus. Rarely, mutations in the BRAF gene are responsible for this condition. The proteins produced from these genes are involved in a process known as signal transduction by which signals are relayed from outside the cell to the cell s nucleus. Signals relayed by the N Ras and BRAF proteins instruct the cell to grow and divide proliferate or to mature and take on specialized functions differentiate . To transmit signals, these proteins must be turned on when the proteins are turned off, they do not relay signals to the cell s nucleus. The NRAS or BRAF gene mutations responsible for giant congenital melanocytic nevus are somatic, meaning that they are acquired during a person s lifetime and are present only in certain cells. These mutations occur early in embryonic development during the growth and division proliferation of cells that develop into melanocytes. Somatic NRAS or BRAF gene mutations cause the altered protein in affected cells to be constantly turned on constitutively active and relaying signals. The overactive protein may contribute to the development of giant congenital melanocytic nevus by allowing cells that develop into melanocytes to grow and divide uncontrollably, starting before birth.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Familial male limited precocious puberty can be caused by mutations in the LHCGR gene. This gene provides instructions for making a receptor protein called the luteinizing hormone chorionic gonadotropin receptor. Receptor proteins have specific sites into which certain other proteins, called ligands, fit like keys into locks. Together, ligands and their receptors trigger signals that affect cell development and function. The protein produced from the LHCGR gene acts as a receptor for two ligands luteinizing hormone and a similar hormone called chorionic gonadotropin. The receptor allows the body to respond appropriately to these hormones. In males, chorionic gonadotropin stimulates the development of cells in the testes called Leydig cells, and luteinizing hormone triggers these cells to produce androgens. Androgens, including testosterone, are the hormones that control male sexual development and reproduction. In females, luteinizing hormone triggers the release of egg cells from the ovaries ovulation chorionic gonadotropin is produced during pregnancy and helps maintain conditions necessary for the pregnancy to continue. Certain LHCGR gene mutations result in a receptor protein that is constantly turned on constitutively activated , even when not attached bound to luteinizing hormone or chorionic gonadotropin. In males, the overactive receptor causes excess production of testosterone, which triggers male sexual development and lead to early puberty in affected individuals. The overactive receptor has no apparent effect on females. Approximately 18 percent of individuals with familial male limited precocious puberty have no identified LHCGR gene mutation. In these individuals, the cause of the disorder is unknown.',\n",

Affected individuals have shortened long bones in the arms and legs that are unusually wide at the ends described as dumbbell shaped . People with this condition also have a narrow chest with short, wide ribs and a round and prominent abdomen. The bones of the spine vertebrae are flattened platyspondyly and have a characteristic pinched or pear shape that is noticeable on x rays. Other skeletal abnormalities associated with fibrochondrogenesis include abnormal curvature of the spine and underdeveloped hip pelvic bones. People with fibrochondrogenesis also have distinctive facial features. These include prominent eyes, low set ears, a small mouth with a long upper lip, and a small chin micrognathia . Affected individuals have a relatively flat appearing midface, particularly a small nose with a flat nasal bridge and nostrils that open to the front rather than downward anteverted nares . Vision problems, including severe nearsightedness high myopia and clouding of the lens of the eye cataract , are common in those who survive infancy.

       "  'answer': 'Fibrochondrogenesis can result from mutations in the COL11A1 or COL11A2 gene. These genes provide instructions for making components of type XI collagen, which is a complex molecule that gives structure and strength to the connective tissues that support the body s joints and organs. Specifically, type XI collagen is found in cartilage, a tough but flexible tissue that makes up much of the skeleton during early development. Most cartilage is later converted to bone, except for the cartilage that continues to cover and protect the ends of bones and is present in the nose and external ears. Type XI collagen is also part of the inner ear the vitreous, which is the clear gel that fills the eyeball and the nucleus pulposus, which is the center portion of the discs between vertebrae. Mutations in the COL11A1 or COL11A2 gene impair the assembly of type XI collagen, in most cases leading to the production of abnormal collagen molecules. The defective collagen weakens connective tissues, impairing the formation of bones throughout the skeleton and causing changes in the eye and inner ear that lead to vision and hearing problems.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'GPI deficiency is caused by mutations in the GPI gene, which provides instructions for making an enzyme called glucose phosphate isomerase GPI . This enzyme has two distinct functions based on its structure. When two GPI molecules form a complex a homodimer , the enzyme plays a role in a critical energy producing process known as glycolysis, also called the glycolytic pathway. During glycolysis, the simple sugar glucose is broken down to produce energy. Specifically, GPI is involved in the second step of the glycolytic pathway in this step, a molecule called glucose 6 phosphate is converted to another molecule called fructose 6 phosphate. When GPI remains a single molecule a monomer it is involved in the development and maintenance of nerve cells neurons . In this context, it is often known as neuroleukin NLK . Some GPI gene mutations may result in a less stable homodimer, impairing the activity of the enzyme in the glycolytic pathway. The resulting imbalance of molecules involved in the glycolytic pathway eventually impairs the ability of red blood cells to maintain their structure, leading to hemolysis. Other GPI gene mutations may cause the monomer to break down more easily, thereby interfering with its function in nerve cells. In addition, the shortage of monomers hinders homodimer formation, which impairs the glycolytic pathway. These mutations have been identified in individuals with GPI deficiency who have both hemolytic anemia and neurological problems.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva FOP is a disorder in which muscle tissue and connective tissue such as tendons and ligaments are gradually replaced by bone ossified , forming bone outside the skeleton extra skeletal or heterotopic bone that constrains movement. This process generally becomes noticeable in early childhood, starting with the neck and shoulders and proceeding down the body and into the limbs. Extra skeletal bone formation causes progressive loss of mobility as the joints become affected. Inability to fully open the mouth may cause difficulty in speaking and eating. Over time, people with this disorder may experience malnutrition due to their eating problems. They may also have breathing difficulties as a result of extra bone formation around the rib cage that restricts expansion of the lungs. Any trauma to the muscles of an individual with fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva, such as a fall or invasive medical procedures, may trigger episodes of muscle swelling and inflammation myositis followed by more rapid ossification in the injured area. Flare ups may also be caused by viral illnesses such as influenza. People with fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva are generally born with malformed big toes. This abnormality of the big toes is a characteristic feature that helps to distinguish this disorder from other bone and muscle problems. Affected individuals may also have short thumbs and other skeletal abnormalities.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency is a genetic disorder that occurs most often in males. This condition mainly affects red blood cells, which carry oxygen from the lungs to tissues throughout the body. In affected individuals, a defect in an enzyme called glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase causes red blood cells to break down prematurely. This destruction of red blood cells is called hemolysis. The most common medical problem associated with glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency is hemolytic anemia, which occurs when red blood cells are destroyed faster than the body can replace them. This type of anemia leads to paleness, yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes jaundice , dark urine, fatigue, shortness of breath, and a rapid heart rate. In people with glucose 6 dehydrogenase deficiency, hemolytic anemia is most often triggered by bacterial or viral infections or by certain drugs such as some antibiotics and medications used to treat malaria . Hemolytic anemia can also occur after eating fava beans or inhaling pollen from fava plants a reaction called favism . Glucose 6 dehydrogenase deficiency is also a significant cause of mild to severe jaundice in newborns. Many people with this disorder, however, never experience any signs or symptoms.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mutations in the G6PD gene cause glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency. The G6PD gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase. This enzyme is involved in the normal processing of carbohydrates. It also protects red blood cells from the effects of potentially harmful molecules called reactive oxygen species. Reactive oxygen species are byproducts of normal cellular functions. Chemical reactions involving glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase produce compounds that prevent reactive oxygen species from building up to toxic levels within red blood cells. If mutations in the G6PD gene reduce the amount of glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase or alter its structure, this enzyme can no longer play its protective role. As a result, reactive oxygen species can accumulate and damage red blood cells. Factors such as infections, certain drugs, or ingesting fava beans can increase the levels of reactive oxygen species, causing red blood cells to be destroyed faster than the body can replace them. A reduction in the amount of red blood cells causes the signs and symptoms of hemolytic anemia. Researchers believe that carriers of a G6PD mutation may be partially protected against malaria, an infectious disease carried by a certain type of mosquito. A reduction in the amount of functional glucose 6 dehydrogenase appears to make it more difficult for this parasite to invade red blood cells. Glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency occurs most frequently in areas of the world where malaria is common.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Gilbert syndrome is a relatively mild condition characterized by periods of elevated levels of a toxic substance called bilirubin in the blood hyperbilirubinemia . Bilirubin, which has an orange yellow tint, is produced when red blood cells are broken down. This substance is removed from the body only after it undergoes a chemical reaction in the liver, which converts the toxic form of bilirubin unconjugated bilirubin to a nontoxic form called conjugated bilirubin. People with Gilbert syndrome have a buildup of unconjugated bilirubin in their blood unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia . In affected individuals, bilirubin levels fluctuate and very rarely increase to levels that cause jaundice, which is yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes. Gilbert syndrome is usually recognized in adolescence. If people with this condition have episodes of hyperbilirubinemia, these episodes are generally mild and typically occur when the body is under stress, for instance because of dehydration, prolonged periods without food fasting , illness, vigorous exercise, or menstruation. Some people with Gilbert syndrome also experience abdominal discomfort or tiredness. However, approximately 30 percent of people with Gilbert syndrome have no signs or symptoms of the condition and are discovered only when routine blood tests reveal elevated unconjugated bilirubin levels.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Changes in the UGT1A1 gene cause Gilbert syndrome. This gene provides instructions for making the bilirubin uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase bilirubin UGT enzyme, which is found primarily in liver cells and is necessary for the removal of bilirubin from the body. The bilirubin UGT enzyme performs a chemical reaction called glucuronidation. During this reaction, the enzyme transfers a compound called glucuronic acid to unconjugated bilirubin, converting it to conjugated bilirubin. Glucuronidation makes bilirubin dissolvable in water so that it can be removed from the body. Gilbert syndrome occurs worldwide, but some mutations occur more often in particular populations. In many populations, the most common genetic change that causes Gilbert syndrome known as UGT1A1 28 occurs in an area near the UGT1A1 gene called the promoter region, which controls the production of the bilirubin UGT enzyme. This genetic change impairs enzyme production. However, this change is uncommon in Asian populations, and affected Asians often have a mutation that changes a single protein building block amino acid in the bilirubin UGT enzyme. This type of mutation, known as a missense mutation, results in reduced enzyme function. People with Gilbert syndrome have approximately 30 percent of normal bilirubin UGT enzyme function. As a result, unconjugated bilirubin is not glucuronidated quickly enough. This toxic substance then builds up in the body, causing mild hyperbilirubinemia. Not everyone with the genetic changes that cause Gilbert syndrome develops hyperbilirubinemia, indicating that additional factors, such as conditions that further hinder the glucuronidation process, may be necessary for development of the condition. For example, red blood cells may break down too easily, releasing excess amounts of bilirubin that the impaired enzyme cannot keep up with. Alternatively, movement of bilirubin into the liver, where it would be glucuronidated, may be impaired. These other factors may be due to changes in other genes.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mutations in the MEFV gene cause familial Mediterranean fever. The MEFV gene provides instructions for making a protein called pyrin also known as marenostrin , which is found in white blood cells. This protein is involved in the immune system, helping to regulate the process of inflammation. Inflammation occurs when the immune system sends signaling molecules and white blood cells to a site of injury or disease to fight microbial invaders and facilitate tissue repair. When this process is complete, the body stops the inflammatory response to prevent damage to its own cells and tissues. Mutations in the MEFV gene reduce the activity of the pyrin protein, which disrupts control of the inflammation process. An inappropriate or prolonged inflammatory response can result, leading to fever and pain in the abdomen, chest, or joints. Normal variations in the SAA1 gene may modify the course of familial Mediterranean fever.

       "  'answer': 'Familial Mediterranean fever is almost always inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the MEFV gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition. In rare cases, this condition appears to be inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. An autosomal dominant inheritance pattern describes cases in which one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In autosomal dominant inheritance, affected individuals often inherit the mutation from one affected parent. However, another mechanism is believed to account for some cases of familial Mediterranean fever that were originally thought to be inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. A gene mutation that occurs frequently in a population may result in a disorder with autosomal recessive inheritance appearing in multiple generations in a family, a pattern that mimics autosomal dominant inheritance. If one parent has familial Mediterranean fever with mutations in both copies of the MEFV gene in each cell and the other parent is an unaffected carrier with a mutation in one copy of the MEFV gene in each cell , it may appear as if the affected child inherited the disorder only from the affected parent. This appearance of autosomal dominant inheritance when the pattern is actually autosomal recessive is called pseudodominance.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Familial glucocorticoid deficiency is a condition that occurs when the adrenal glands, which are hormone producing glands located on top of each kidney, do not produce certain hormones called glucocorticoids. These hormones, which include cortisol and corticosterone, aid in immune system function, play a role in maintaining normal blood sugar levels, help trigger nerve cell signaling in the brain, and serve many other purposes in the body. A shortage of adrenal hormones adrenal insufficiency causes the signs and symptoms of familial glucocorticoid deficiency. These signs and symptoms often begin in infancy or early childhood. Most affected children first develop low blood sugar hypoglycemia . These hypoglycemic children can fail to grow and gain weight at the expected rate failure to thrive . If left untreated, hypoglycemia can lead to seizures, learning difficulties, and other neurological problems. Hypoglycemia that is left untreated for prolonged periods can lead to neurological damage and death. Other features of familial glucocorticoid deficiency can include recurrent infections and skin coloring darker than that of other family members hyperpigmentation . There are multiple types of familial glucocorticoid deficiency, which are distinguished by their genetic cause.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mutations in the MC2R, MRAP, and NNT genes account for the majority of cases of familial glucocorticoid deficiency mutations in other genes, some known and some unidentified, can also cause this condition. The MC2R gene provides instructions for making a protein called adrenocorticotropic hormone ACTH receptor, which is found primarily in the adrenal glands. The protein produced from the MRAP gene transports the ACTH receptor from the interior of the cell to the cell membrane. When the ACTH receptor is embedded within the cell membrane, it is turned on activated by the MRAP protein. Activated ACTH receptor can then attach bind to ACTH, and this binding triggers the adrenal glands to produce glucocorticoids. MC2R gene mutations lead to the production of a receptor that cannot be transported to the cell membrane or, if it does get to the cell membrane, cannot bind to ACTH. MRAP gene mutations impair the transport of the ACTH receptor to the cell membrane. Without the binding of the ACTH receptor to its hormone, there is no signal to trigger the adrenal glands to produce glucocorticoids. The NNT gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase. This enzyme is found embedded in the inner membrane of structures called mitochondria, which are the energy producing centers of cells. This enzyme helps produce a substance called NADPH, which is involved in removing potentially toxic molecules called reactive oxygen species that can damage DNA, proteins, and cell membranes. NNT gene mutations impair the enzyme s ability to produce NADPH, leading to an increase in reactive oxygen species in adrenal gland tissues. Over time, these toxic molecules can impair the function of adrenal gland cells and lead to their death apoptosis , diminishing the production of glucocorticoids.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'X linked juvenile retinoschisis is a condition characterized by impaired vision that begins in childhood and occurs almost exclusively in males. This disorder affects the retina, which is a specialized light sensitive tissue that lines the back of the eye. Damage to the retina impairs the sharpness of vision visual acuity in both eyes. Typically, X linked juvenile retinoschisis affects cells in the central area of the retina called the macula. The macula is responsible for sharp central vision, which is needed for detailed tasks such as reading, driving, and recognizing faces. X linked juvenile retinoschisis is one type of a broader disorder called macular degeneration, which disrupts the normal functioning of the macula. Occasionally, side peripheral vision is affected in people with X linked juvenile retinoschisis. X linked juvenile retinoschisis is usually diagnosed when affected boys start school and poor vision and difficulty with reading become apparent. In more severe cases, eye squinting and involuntary movement of the eyes nystagmus begin in infancy. Other early features of X linked juvenile retinoschisis include eyes that do not look in the same direction strabismus and farsightedness hyperopia . Visual acuity often declines in childhood and adolescence but then stabilizes throughout adulthood until a significant decline in visual acuity typically occurs in a man s fifties or sixties. Sometimes, severe complications develop, such as separation of the retinal layers retinal detachment or leakage of blood vessels in the retina vitreous hemorrhage . These eye abnormalities can further impair vision or cause blindness.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mutations in the RS1 gene cause most cases of X linked juvenile retinoschisis. The RS1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called retinoschisin, which is found in the retina. Studies suggest that retinoschisin plays a role in the development and maintenance of the retina. The protein is probably involved in the organization of cells in the retina by attaching cells together cell adhesion . RS1 gene mutations result in a decrease in or complete loss of functional retinoschisin, which disrupts the maintenance and organization of cells in the retina. As a result, tiny splits schisis or tears form in the retina. This damage often forms a spoke wheel pattern in the macula, which can be seen during an eye examination. In half of affected individuals, these abnormalities can occur in the area of the macula, affecting visual acuity, in the other half of cases the schisis occurs in the sides of the retina, resulting in impaired peripheral vision. Some individuals with X linked juvenile retinoschisis do not have a mutation in the RS1 gene. In these individuals, the cause of the disorder is unknown.',\n",

       "  'answer': '3MC syndrome is caused by mutations in the COLEC11 or MASP1 gene. These genes provide instructions for making proteins that are involved in a series of reactions called the lectin complement pathway. This pathway is thought to help direct the movement migration of cells during early development before birth to form the organs and systems of the body. It appears to be particularly important in directing the migration of neural crest cells, which give rise to various tissues including many tissues in the face and skull, the glands that produce hormones endocrine glands , and portions of the nervous system. The COLEC11 gene provides instructions for making a protein called CL K1. Three different proteins, MASP 1, MASP 3, and MAp44 can be produced from the MASP1 gene, depending on how the gene s instructions are pieced together. The MASP1 gene mutations identified in people with 3MC syndrome affect the MASP 3 protein some affect the MASP 1 protein in addition to MASP 3. COLEC11 and MASP1 gene mutations that cause 3MC syndrome impair or eliminate the function of the corresponding proteins, resulting in faulty control of cell migration in embryonic development and leading to the various abnormalities that occur in this disorder. In some people with 3MC syndrome, no mutations in the COLEC11 or MASP1 gene have been identified. In these individuals, the cause of the disorder is unknown.',\n",

The MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2 genes are involved in the repair of mistakes that occur when DNA is copied in preparation for cell division a process called DNA replication . Mutations in any of these genes prevent the proper repair of DNA replication mistakes. As the abnormal cells continue to divide, the accumulated mistakes can lead to uncontrolled cell growth and possibly cancer. Mutations in the EPCAM gene also lead to impaired DNA repair, although the gene is not itself involved in this process. The EPCAM gene lies next to the MSH2 gene on chromosome 2 certain EPCAM gene mutations cause the MSH2 gene to be turned off inactivated , interrupting DNA repair and leading to accumulated DNA mistakes. Although mutations in these genes predispose individuals to cancer, not all people who carry these mutations develop cancerous tumors.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'MCHS is caused by mutations in the POLG gene. This gene provides instructions for making one part, the alpha subunit, of a protein called polymerase gamma pol . Pol functions in mitochondria, which are structures within cells that use oxygen to convert the energy from food into a form cells can use. Mitochondria each contain a small amount of DNA, known as mitochondrial DNA mtDNA , which is essential for the normal function of these structures. Pol reads sequences of mtDNA and uses them as templates to produce new copies of mtDNA in a process called DNA replication. Most POLG gene mutations change single protein building blocks amino acids in the alpha subunit of pol . These changes result in a mutated pol that has a reduced ability to replicate DNA. Although the mechanism is unknown, mutations in the POLG gene often result in fewer copies of mtDNA mtDNA depletion , particularly in muscle, brain, or liver cells. MtDNA depletion causes a decrease in cellular energy, which could account for the signs and symptoms of MCHS.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Celiac disease is a condition in which the immune system is abnormally sensitive to gluten, a protein found in wheat, rye, and barley. Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder autoimmune disorders occur when the immune system malfunctions and attacks the body s own tissues and organs. Without a strict, lifelong gluten free diet, inflammation resulting from immune system overactivity may cause a wide variety of signs and symptoms involving many parts of the body. Celiac disease can develop at any age after an individual starts eating foods containing gluten. The classic symptoms of the condition result from inflammation affecting the gastrointestinal tract. This inflammation damages the villi, which are small, finger like projections that line the small intestine and provide a greatly increased surface area to absorb nutrients. In celiac disease, the villi become shortened and eventually flatten out. Intestinal damage causes diarrhea and poor absorption of nutrients, which may lead to weight loss. Abdominal pain, swelling distention , and food intolerances are common in celiac disease. Inflammation associated with celiac disease may lead to an increased risk of developing certain gastrointestinal cancers such as cancers of the small intestine or esophagus. Inflammation and poor nutrient absorption may lead to problems affecting many other organs and systems of the body in affected individuals. These health problems may include iron deficiency that results in a low number of red blood cells anemia , vitamin deficiencies, low bone mineral density osteoporosis , itchy skin rashes dermatitis herpetiformis , defects in the enamel of the teeth, chronic fatigue, joint pain, poor growth, delayed puberty, infertility, or repeated miscarriages. Neurological problems have also been associated with celiac disease these include migraine headaches, depression, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ADHD , and recurrent seizures epilepsy . Many people with celiac disease have one or more of these varied health problems but do not have gastrointestinal symptoms. This form of the condition is called nonclassic celiac disease. Researchers now believe that nonclassic celiac disease is actually more common than the classic form. Celiac disease often goes undiagnosed because many of its signs and symptoms are nonspecific, which means they may occur in many disorders. Most people who have one or more of these nonspecific health problems do not have celiac disease. On average, a diagnosis of celiac disease is not made until 6 to 10 years after symptoms begin. Some people have silent celiac disease, in which they have no symptoms of the disorder. However, people with silent celiac disease do have immune proteins in their blood antibodies that are common in celiac disease. They also have inflammatory damage to their small intestine that can be detected with a biopsy. In a small number of cases, celiac disease does not improve with a gluten free diet and progresses to a condition called refractory sprue. Refractory sprue is characterized by chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, poor absorption of nutrients, and an increased risk of developing a type of cancer of the immune cells called T cell lymphoma.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'The risk of developing celiac disease is increased by certain variants of the HLA DQA1 and HLA DQB1 genes. These genes provide instructions for making proteins that play a critical role in the immune system. The HLA DQA1 and HLA DQB1 genes belong to a family of genes called the human leukocyte antigen HLA complex. The HLA complex helps the immune system distinguish the body s own proteins from proteins made by foreign invaders such as viruses and bacteria. The proteins produced from the HLA DQA1 and HLA DQB1 genes attach bind to each other to form a functional protein complex called an antigen binding DQ heterodimer. This complex, which is present on the surface of certain immune system cells, attaches to protein fragments peptides outside the cell. If the immune system recognizes the peptides as foreign such as viral or bacterial peptides , it triggers a response to attack the invading viruses or bacteria. Celiac disease is associated with an inappropriate immune response to a segment of the gluten protein called gliadin. This inappropriate activation of the immune system causes inflammation that damages the body s organs and tissues and leads to the signs and symptoms of celiac disease. Almost all people with celiac disease have specific variants of the HLA DQA1 and HLA DQB1 genes, which seem to increase the risk of an inappropriate immune response to gliadin. However, these variants are also found in 30 percent of the general population, and only 3 percent of individuals with the gene variants develop celiac disease. It appears likely that other contributors, such as environmental factors and changes in other genes, also influence the development of this complex disorder.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mutations in the HADHA gene cause LCHAD deficiency. The HADHA gene provides instructions for making part of an enzyme complex called mitochondrial trifunctional protein. This enzyme complex functions in mitochondria, the energy producing centers within cells. As the name suggests, mitochondrial trifunctional protein contains three enzymes that each perform a different function. This enzyme complex is required to break down metabolize a group of fats called long chain fatty acids. Long chain fatty acids are found in foods such as milk and certain oils. These fatty acids are stored in the body s fat tissues. Fatty acids are a major source of energy for the heart and muscles. During periods of fasting, fatty acids are also an important energy source for the liver and other tissues. Mutations in the HADHA gene that cause LCHAD deficiency disrupt one of the functions of this enzyme complex. These mutations prevent the normal processing of long chain fatty acids from food and body fat. As a result, these fatty acids are not converted to energy, which can lead to some features of this disorder, such as lethargy and hypoglycemia. Long chain fatty acids or partially metabolized fatty acids may also build up and damage the liver, heart, muscles, and retina. This abnormal buildup causes the other signs and symptoms of LCHAD deficiency.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Meesmann corneal dystrophy is an eye disease that affects the cornea, which is the clear front covering of the eye. This condition is characterized by the formation of tiny round cysts in the outermost layer of the cornea, called the corneal epithelium. This part of the cornea acts as a barrier to help prevent foreign materials, such as dust and bacteria, from entering the eye. In people with Meesmann corneal dystrophy, cysts can appear as early as the first year of life. They usually affect both eyes and increase in number over time. The cysts usually do not cause any symptoms until late adolescence or adulthood, when they start to break open rupture on the surface of the cornea and cause irritation. The resulting symptoms typically include increased sensitivity to light photophobia , twitching of the eyelids blepharospasm , increased tear production, the sensation of having a foreign object in the eye, and an inability to tolerate wearing contact lenses. Some affected individuals also have temporary episodes of blurred vision.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Prostate cancer is a common disease that affects men, usually in middle age or later. In this disorder, certain cells in the prostate become abnormal and multiply without control or order to form a tumor. The prostate is a gland that surrounds the male urethra and helps produce semen, the fluid that carries sperm. Early prostate cancer usually does not cause pain, and most affected men exhibit no noticeable symptoms. Men are often diagnosed as the result of health screenings, such as a blood test for a substance called prostate specific antigen PSA or a medical procedure called a digital rectal exam. As the tumor grows larger, signs and symptoms can include difficulty starting or stopping the flow of urine, a feeling of not being able to empty the bladder completely, blood in the urine or semen, or pain with ejaculation. However, these changes can also occur with many other genitourinary conditions. Having one or more of these symptoms does not necessarily mean that a man has prostate cancer. The severity and outcome of prostate cancer varies widely. Early stage prostate cancer can usually be treated successfully, and some older men have prostate tumors that grow so slowly that they may never cause health problems during their lifetime, even without treatment. In other men, however, the cancer is much more aggressive in these cases, prostate cancer can be life threatening. Some cancerous tumors can invade surrounding tissue and spread to other parts of the body. Tumors that begin at one site and then spread to other areas of the body are called metastatic cancers. The signs and symptoms of metastatic cancer depend on where the disease has spread. If prostate cancer spreads, cancerous cells most often appear in the lymph nodes, bones, lungs, liver, or brain. Bone metastases of prostate cancer most often cause pain in the lower back, pelvis, or hips. A small percentage of all prostate cancers cluster in families. These hereditary cancers are associated with inherited gene mutations. Hereditary prostate cancers tend to develop earlier in life than non inherited sporadic cases.',\n",

In addition, studies indicate that many older men have undiagnosed prostate cancer that is non aggressive and unlikely to cause symptoms or affect their lifespan. While most men who are diagnosed with prostate cancer do not die from it, this common cancer is still the second leading cause of cancer death among men in the United States. More than 60 percent of prostate cancers are diagnosed after age 65, and the disorder is rare before age 40. In the United States, African Americans have a higher risk of developing prostate cancer than do men of other ethnic backgrounds, and they also have a higher risk of dying from the disease.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Cancers occur when genetic mutations build up in critical genes, specifically those that control cell growth and division or the repair of damaged DNA. These changes allow cells to grow and divide uncontrollably to form a tumor. In most cases of prostate cancer, these genetic changes are acquired during a man s lifetime and are present only in certain cells in the prostate. These changes, which are called somatic mutations, are not inherited. Somatic mutations in many different genes have been found in prostate cancer cells. Less commonly, genetic changes present in essentially all of the body s cells increase the risk of developing prostate cancer. These genetic changes, which are classified as germline mutations, are usually inherited from a parent. In people with germline mutations, changes in other genes, together with environmental and lifestyle factors, also influence whether a person will develop prostate cancer. Inherited mutations in particular genes, such as BRCA1, BRCA2, and HOXB13, account for some cases of hereditary prostate cancer. Men with mutations in these genes have a high risk of developing prostate cancer and, in some cases, other cancers during their lifetimes. In addition, men with BRCA2 or HOXB13 gene mutations may have a higher risk of developing life threatening forms of prostate cancer. The proteins produced from the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are involved in fixing damaged DNA, which helps to maintain the stability of a cell s genetic information. For this reason, the BRCA1 and BRCA2 proteins are considered to be tumor suppressors, which means that they help keep cells from growing and dividing too fast or in an uncontrolled way. Mutations in these genes impair the cell s ability to fix damaged DNA, allowing potentially damaging mutations to persist. As these defects accumulate, they can trigger cells to grow and divide uncontrollably and form a tumor. The HOXB13 gene provides instructions for producing a protein that attaches binds to specific regions of DNA and regulates the activity of other genes. On the basis of this role, the protein produced from the HOXB13 gene is called a transcription factor. Like BRCA1 and BRCA2, the HOXB13 protein is thought to act as a tumor suppressor. HOXB13 gene mutations may result in impairment of the protein s tumor suppressor function, resulting in the uncontrolled cell growth and division that can lead to prostate cancer. Inherited variations in dozens of other genes have been studied as possible risk factors for prostate cancer. Some of these genes provide instructions for making proteins that interact with the proteins produced from the BRCA1, BRCA2, or HOXB13 genes. Others act as tumor suppressors through different pathways. Changes in these genes probably make only a small contribution to overall prostate cancer risk. However, researchers suspect that the combined influence of variations in many of these genes may significantly impact a person s risk of developing this form of cancer. In many families, the genetic changes associated with hereditary prostate cancer are unknown. Identifying additional genetic risk factors for prostate cancer is an active area of medical research. In addition to genetic changes, researchers have identified many personal and environmental factors that may contribute to a person s risk of developing prostate cancer. These factors include a high fat diet that includes an excess of meat and dairy and not enough vegetables, a largely inactive sedentary lifestyle, obesity, excessive alcohol use, or exposure to certain toxic chemicals. A history of prostate cancer in closely related family members is also an important risk factor, particularly if the cancer occurred at an early age.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Many cases of prostate cancer are not related to inherited gene changes. These cancers are associated with somatic mutations that occur only in certain cells in the prostate. When prostate cancer is related to inherited gene changes, the way that cancer risk is inherited depends on the gene involved. For example, mutations in the BRCA1, BRCA2, and HOXB13 genes are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to increase a person s chance of developing cancer. In other cases, the inheritance of prostate cancer risk is unclear. It is important to note that people inherit an increased risk of cancer, not the disease itself. Not all people who inherit mutations in these genes will develop cancer.',\n",

Sufficient levels of fats, cholesterol, and vitamins are necessary for normal growth and development. The signs and symptoms of chylomicron retention disease appear in the first few months of life. They can include failure to gain weight and grow at the expected rate failure to thrive diarrhea and fatty, foul smelling stools steatorrhea .

       "  'answer': 'In about half of individuals with PMAH, the condition is caused by mutations in the ARMC5 gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein that is thought to act as a tumor suppressor, which means that it helps to prevent cells from growing and dividing too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way. ARMC5 gene mutations are believed to impair the protein s tumor suppressor function, which allows the overgrowth of certain cells. It is unclear why this overgrowth is limited to the formation of adrenal gland nodules in people with PMAH. PMAH can also be caused by mutations in the GNAS gene. This gene provides instructions for making one component, the stimulatory alpha subunit, of a protein complex called a guanine nucleotide binding protein G protein . The G protein produced from the GNAS gene helps stimulate the activity of an enzyme called adenylate cyclase. This enzyme is involved in controlling the production of several hormones that help regulate the activity of certain endocrine glands, including the adrenal glands. The GNAS gene mutations that cause PMAH are believed to result in an overactive G protein. Research suggests that the overactive G protein may increase levels of adenylate cyclase and result in the overproduction of another compound called cyclic AMP cAMP . An excess of cAMP may trigger abnormal cell growth and lead to the adrenal nodules characteristic of PMAH. Mutations in other genes, some of which are unknown, can also cause PMAH.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'People with PMAH caused by ARMC5 gene mutations inherit one copy of the mutated gene in each cell. The inheritance is considered autosomal dominant because one copy of the mutated gene is sufficient to make an individual susceptible to PMAH. However, the condition develops only when affected individuals acquire another mutation in the other copy of the ARMC5 gene in certain cells of the adrenal glands. This second mutation is described as somatic. Instead of being passed from parent to child, somatic mutations are acquired during a person s lifetime and are present only in certain cells. Because somatic mutations are also required for PMAH to occur, some people who have inherited the altered ARMC5 gene never develop the condition, a situation known as reduced penetrance. When PMAH is caused by GNAS gene mutations, the condition is not inherited. The GNAS gene mutations that cause PMAH are somatic mutations. In PMAH, the gene mutation is believed to occur early in embryonic development. Cells with the mutated GNAS gene can be found in both adrenal glands.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Pachyonychia congenita is a condition that primarily affects the nails and skin. The signs and symptoms of this condition usually become apparent within the first few months of life. Almost everyone with pachyonychia congenita has hypertrophic nail dystrophy, which causes the fingernails and toenails to become thick and abnormally shaped. Many affected children also develop very painful blisters and calluses on the soles of the feet and, less commonly, on the palms of the hands. This condition is known as palmoplantar keratoderma. Severe blisters and calluses on the feet can make it painful or impossible to walk. Pachyonychia congenita can have several additional features, which vary among affected individuals. These features include thick, white patches on the tongue and inside of the cheeks oral leukokeratosis bumps called follicular keratoses that develop around hair follicles on the elbows, knees, and waistline cysts in the armpits, groin, back, or scalp and excessive sweating on the palms and soles palmoplantar hyperhidrosis . Some affected individuals also develop widespread cysts called steatocystomas, which are filled with an oily substance called sebum that normally lubricates the skin and hair. Some babies with pachyonychia congenita have prenatal or natal teeth, which are teeth that are present at birth or in early infancy. Rarely, pachyonychia congenita can affect the voice box larynx , potentially leading to hoarseness or breathing problems. Researchers used to split pachyonychia congenita into two types, PC 1 and PC 2, based on the genetic cause and pattern of signs and symptoms. However, as more affected individuals were identified, it became clear that the features of the two types overlapped considerably. Now researchers prefer to describe pachyonychia congenita based on the gene that is altered.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mutations in several genes, including KRT6A, KRT6B, KRT6C, KRT16, and KRT17, can cause pachyonychia congenita. All of these genes provide instructions for making tough, fibrous proteins called keratins. These proteins form networks that provide strength and resilience to the tissues that make up the skin, hair, and nails. When pachyonychia congenita is caused by mutations in the KRT6A gene, it is classified as PC K6a. Similarly, KRT6B gene mutations cause PC K6b, KRT6C gene mutations cause PC K6c, KRT16 gene mutations cause PC K16, and KRT17 gene mutations cause PC K17. Mutations in keratin genes alter the structure of keratin proteins, which prevents these proteins from forming strong, stable networks within cells. Without this network, skin cells become fragile and are easily damaged, making the skin less resistant to friction and minor trauma. Even normal activities such as walking can cause skin cells to break down, resulting in the formation of severe, painful blisters and calluses. Defective keratins also disrupt the growth and function of cells in the hair follicles and nails, resulting in the other features of pachyonychia congenita.',\n",

People affected by this disorder are not able to make certain lipoproteins, which are particles that carry fats and fat like substances such as cholesterol in the blood. Specifically, people with abetalipoproteinemia are missing a group of lipoproteins called beta lipoproteins. An inability to make beta lipoproteins causes severely reduced absorption malabsorption of dietary fats and fat soluble vitamins vitamins A, D, E, and K from the digestive tract into the bloodstream. Sufficient levels of fats, cholesterol, and vitamins are necessary for normal growth, development, and maintenance of the body s cells and tissues, particularly nerve cells and tissues in the eye. The signs and symptoms of abetalipoproteinemia appear in the first few months of life. They can include failure to gain weight and grow at the expected rate failure to thrive diarrhea abnormal star shaped red blood cells acanthocytosis and fatty, foul smelling stools steatorrhea . Other features of this disorder may develop later in childhood and often impair the function of the nervous system. Disturbances in nerve function may cause affected people to eventually develop poor muscle coordination and difficulty with balance and movement ataxia . Individuals with this condition may also develop an eye disorder called retinitis pigmentosa, in which progressive degeneration of the light sensitive layer retina at the back of the eye can cause vision loss. Adults in their thirties or forties may have increasing difficulty with balance and walking. Many of the signs and symptoms of abetalipoproteinemia result from a severe vitamin deficiency, especially a deficiency of vitamin E.',\n",

Beginning in infancy or early childhood, people with this condition experience bouts of sustained muscle tensing myotonia that prevent muscles from relaxing normally. Myotonia causes muscle stiffness that typically appears after exercise and can be induced by muscle cooling. This stiffness chiefly affects muscles in the face, neck, arms, and hands, although it can also affect muscles used for breathing and muscles in the lower body. Unlike many other forms of myotonia, the muscle stiffness associated with paramyotonia congenita tends to worsen with repeated movements. Most peopleeven those without muscle diseasefeel that their muscles do not work as well when they are cold. This effect is dramatic in people with paramyotonia congenita. Exposure to cold initially causes muscle stiffness in these individuals, and prolonged cold exposure leads to temporary episodes of mild to severe muscle weakness that may last for several hours at a time.

The first sign is usually weakness and wasting atrophy of a muscle in the lower leg called the tibialis anterior. This muscle helps control up and down movement of the foot. Weakness in the tibialis anterior muscle makes it difficult or impossible to walk on the heels, but it usually does not interfere significantly with regular walking. Muscle weakness worsens very slowly in people with tibial muscular dystrophy. Ten to 20 years after the onset of symptoms, weakness may develop in muscles that help extend the toes long toe extensors . Weakness in these muscles makes it difficult to lift the toes while walking, a condition known as foot drop. Later in life, about one third of people with tibial muscular dystrophy experience mild to moderate difficulty with walking because of weakness in other leg muscles. However, most affected individuals remain able to walk throughout their lives. A small percentage of people with tibial muscular dystrophy have a somewhat different pattern of signs and symptoms than those described above.

       "  'answer': 'Mutations in the TTN gene cause tibial muscular dystrophy. This gene provides instructions for making a protein called titin. Titin plays an important role in muscles the body uses for movement skeletal muscles and in heart cardiac muscle. Within muscle cells, titin is an essential component of structures called sarcomeres. Sarcomeres are the basic units of muscle contraction they are made of proteins that generate the mechanical force needed for muscles to contract. Titin has several functions within sarcomeres. One of its most important jobs is to provide structure, flexibility, and stability to these cell structures. Titin also plays a role in chemical signaling and in assembling new sarcomeres. Mutations in the TTN gene alter the structure and function of titin. Researchers suspect that these changes may disrupt titin s interactions with other proteins within sarcomeres. Mutations may also interfere with the protein s role in chemical signaling. The altered titin protein disrupts normal muscle contraction, which causes muscles to weaken and waste away over time.

       "  'answer': 'Osteopetrosis is a bone disease that makes bones abnormally dense and prone to breakage fracture . Researchers have described several major types of osteopetrosis, which are usually distinguished by their pattern of inheritance autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or X linked. The different types of the disorder can also be distinguished by the severity of their signs and symptoms. Autosomal dominant osteopetrosis ADO , which is also called Albers Schnberg disease, is typically the mildest type of the disorder. Some affected individuals have no symptoms. In these people, the unusually dense bones may be discovered by accident when an x ray is done for another reason. In affected individuals who develop signs and symptoms, the major features of the condition include multiple bone fractures, abnormal side to side curvature of the spine scoliosis or other spinal abnormalities, arthritis in the hips, and a bone infection called osteomyelitis. These problems usually become apparent in late childhood or adolescence. Autosomal recessive osteopetrosis ARO is a more severe form of the disorder that becomes apparent in early infancy. Affected individuals have a high risk of bone fracture resulting from seemingly minor bumps and falls. Their abnormally dense skull bones pinch nerves in the head and face cranial nerves , often resulting in vision loss, hearing loss, and paralysis of facial muscles. Dense bones can also impair the function of bone marrow, preventing it from producing new blood cells and immune system cells. As a result, people with severe osteopetrosis are at risk of abnormal bleeding, a shortage of red blood cells anemia , and recurrent infections. In the most severe cases, these bone marrow abnormalities can be life threatening in infancy or early childhood. Other features of autosomal recessive osteopetrosis can include slow growth and short stature, dental abnormalities, and an enlarged liver and spleen hepatosplenomegaly . Depending on the genetic changes involved, people with severe osteopetrosis can also have brain abnormalities, intellectual disability, or recurrent seizures epilepsy . A few individuals have been diagnosed with intermediate autosomal osteopetrosis IAO , a form of the disorder that can have either an autosomal dominant or an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. The signs and symptoms of this condition become noticeable in childhood and include an increased risk of bone fracture and anemia. People with this form of the disorder typically do not have life threatening bone marrow abnormalities. However, some affected individuals have had abnormal calcium deposits calcifications in the brain, intellectual disability, and a form of kidney disease called renal tubular acidosis. Rarely, osteopetrosis can have an X linked pattern of inheritance. In addition to abnormally dense bones, the X linked form of the disorder is characterized by abnormal swelling caused by a buildup of fluid lymphedema and a condition called anhydrotic ectodermal dysplasia that affects the skin, hair, teeth, and sweat glands. Affected individuals also have a malfunctioning immune system immunodeficiency , which allows severe, recurrent infections to develop. Researchers often refer to this condition as OL EDA ID, an acronym derived from each of the major features of the disorder.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mutations in at least nine genes cause the various types of osteopetrosis. Mutations in the CLCN7 gene are responsible for about 75 percent of cases of autosomal dominant osteopetrosis, 10 to 15 percent of cases of autosomal recessive osteopetrosis, and all known cases of intermediate autosomal osteopetrosis. TCIRG1 gene mutations cause about 50 percent of cases of autosomal recessive osteopetrosis. Mutations in other genes are less common causes of autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive forms of the disorder. The X linked type of osteopetrosis, OL EDA ID, results from mutations in the IKBKG gene. In about 30 percent of all cases of osteopetrosis, the cause of the condition is unknown. The genes associated with osteopetrosis are involved in the formation, development, and function of specialized cells called osteoclasts. These cells break down bone tissue during bone remodeling, a normal process in which old bone is removed and new bone is created to replace it. Bones are constantly being remodeled, and the process is carefully controlled to ensure that bones stay strong and healthy. Mutations in any of the genes associated with osteopetrosis lead to abnormal or missing osteoclasts. Without functional osteoclasts, old bone is not broken down as new bone is formed. As a result, bones throughout the skeleton become unusually dense. The bones are also structurally abnormal, making them prone to fracture. These problems with bone remodeling underlie all of the major features of osteopetrosis.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Osteopetrosis can have several different patterns of inheritance. Most commonly, the disorder has an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, which means one copy of an altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. Most people with autosomal dominant osteopetrosis inherit the condition from an affected parent. Osteopetrosis can also be inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of a gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition. OL EDA ID is inherited in an X linked recessive pattern. The IKBKG gene is located on the X chromosome, which is one of the two sex chromosomes. In males who have only one X chromosome , one altered copy of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. In females who have two X chromosomes , a mutation would have to occur in both copies of the gene to cause the disorder. Because it is unlikely that females will have two altered copies of this gene, males are affected by X linked recessive disorders much more frequently than females. A characteristic of X linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass X linked traits to their sons.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mutations in the CACNA1A gene cause SCA6. The CACNA1A gene provides instructions for making a protein that forms a part of some calcium channels. These channels transport positively charged calcium atoms calcium ions across cell membranes. The movement of these ions is critical for normal signaling between nerve cells neurons in the brain and other parts of the nervous system. The CACNA1A gene provides instructions for making one part the alpha 1 subunit of a calcium channel called CaV2.1. CaV2.1 channels play an essential role in communication between neurons in the brain. The CACNA1A gene mutations that cause SCA6 involve a DNA segment known as a CAG trinucleotide repeat. This segment is made up of a series of three DNA building blocks cytosine, adenine, and guanine that appear multiple times in a row. Normally, the CAG segment is repeated 4 to 18 times within the gene. In people with SCA6, the CAG segment is repeated 20 to 33 times. People with 20 repeats tend to experience signs and symptoms of SCA6 beginning in late adulthood, while people with a larger number of repeats usually have signs and symptoms from mid adulthood. An increase in the length of the CAG segment leads to the production of an abnormally long version of the alpha 1 subunit. This version of the subunit alters the location and function of the CaV2.1 channels. Normally the alpha 1 subunit is located within the cell membrane the abnormal subunit is found in the cell membrane as well as in the fluid inside cells cytoplasm , where it clusters together and forms clumps aggregates . The effect these aggregates have on cell functioning is unknown. The lack of normal calcium channels in the cell membrane impairs cell communication between neurons in the brain. Diminished cell communication leads to cell death. Cells within the cerebellum, which is the part of the brain that coordinates movement, are particularly sensitive to the accumulation of these aggregates. Over time, a loss of cells in the cerebellum causes the movement problems characteristic of SCA6.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Stormorken syndrome is caused by a mutation in the STIM1 gene. The protein produced from this gene is involved in controlling the entry of positively charged calcium atoms calcium ions into cells. The STIM1 protein recognizes when calcium ion levels are low and stimulates the flow of ions into the cell through special channels in the cell membrane called calcium release activated calcium CRAC channels. The flow of calcium ions through CRAC channels triggers signaling within cells that helps control gene activity, cell growth and division, and immune function. The STIM1 gene mutation involved in Stormorken syndrome leads to production of a STIM1 protein that is constantly turned on constitutively active , which means it continually stimulates calcium ion entry through CRAC channels regardless of ion levels. Researchers suggest that the abnormal ion flow in platelets causes the cells to die earlier than usual, leading to thrombocytopenia and bleeding problems in people with Stormorken syndrome.

       "  'answer': 'Cole disease is caused by mutations in the ENPP1 gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein that helps to prevent minerals, including calcium, from being deposited in body tissues where they do not belong. It also plays a role in controlling cell signaling in response to the hormone insulin, through interaction between a part of the ENPP1 protein called the SMB2 domain and the insulin receptor. The insulin receptor is a protein that attaches binds to insulin and initiates cell signaling. Insulin plays many roles in the body, including regulating blood sugar levels by controlling how much sugar in the form of glucose is passed from the bloodstream into cells to be used as energy. Cell signaling in response to insulin is also important for the maintenance of the outer layer of skin the epidermis . It helps control the transport of the pigment melanin from the cells in which it is produced melanocytes to epidermal cells called keratinocytes, and it is also involved in the development of keratinocytes. The mutations that cause Cole disease change the structure of the SMB2 domain, which alters its interaction with the insulin receptor and affects cell signaling. The resulting impairment of ENPP1 s role in melanin transport and keratinocyte development leads to the hypopigmentation and keratoderma that occurs in Cole disease. The mutations may also impair ENPP1 s control of calcification, which likely accounts for the abnormal calcium deposits that occur in some people with this disorder. For reasons that are unclear, the changes in insulin signaling resulting from these ENPP1 gene mutations do not seem to affect blood sugar control.',\n",

The symptoms of Krabbe disease usually begin before the age of 1 year the infantile form . Initial signs and symptoms typically include irritability, muscle weakness, feeding difficulties, episodes of fever without any sign of infection, stiff posture, and slowed mental and physical development. As the disease progresses, muscles continue to weaken, affecting the infant s ability to move, chew, swallow, and breathe. Affected infants also experience vision loss and seizures.

       "  'answer': 'Lactose intolerance is an impaired ability to digest lactose, a sugar found in milk and other dairy products. Lactose is normally broken down by an enzyme called lactase, which is produced by cells in the lining of the small intestine. Congenital lactase deficiency, also called congenital alactasia, is a disorder in which infants are unable to break down lactose in breast milk or formula. This form of lactose intolerance results in severe diarrhea. If affected infants are not given a lactose free infant formula, they may develop severe dehydration and weight loss. Lactose intolerance in adulthood is caused by reduced production of lactase after infancy lactase nonpersistence . If individuals with lactose intolerance consume lactose containing dairy products, they may experience abdominal pain, bloating, flatulence, nausea, and diarrhea beginning 30 minutes to 2 hours later. Most people with lactase nonpersistence retain some lactase activity and can include varying amounts of lactose in their diets without experiencing symptoms. Often, affected individuals have difficulty digesting fresh milk but can eat certain dairy products such as cheese or yogurt without discomfort. These foods are made using fermentation processes that break down much of the lactose in milk.',\n",

Lactose intolerance in adulthood is most prevalent in people of East Asian descent, affecting more than 90 percent of adults in some of these communities. Lactose intolerance is also very common in people of West African, Arab, Jewish, Greek, and Italian descent.

Mutations that cause congenital lactase deficiency are believed to interfere with the function of lactase, causing affected infants to have a severely impaired ability to digest lactose in breast milk or formula. Lactose intolerance in adulthood is caused by gradually decreasing activity expression of the LCT gene after infancy, which occurs in most humans. LCT gene expression is controlled by a DNA sequence called a regulatory element, which is located within a nearby gene called MCM6. Some individuals have inherited changes in this element that lead to sustained lactase production in the small intestine and the ability to digest lactose throughout life.

       "  'answer': 'Mutations in the CFTR gene cause congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens. More than half of all men with this condition have mutations in the CFTR gene. Mutations in this gene also cause cystic fibrosis. When congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens occurs with CFTR mutations, it is considered a form of atypical cystic fibrosis. The protein made from the CFTR gene forms a channel that transports negatively charged particles called chloride ions into and out of cells. The flow of chloride ions helps control the movement of water in tissues, which is necessary for the production of thin, freely flowing mucus. Mucus is a slippery substance that lubricates and protects the linings of the airways, digestive system, reproductive system, and other organs and tissues. Mutations in the CFTR gene disrupt the function of the chloride channels, preventing them from regulating the flow of chloride ions and water across cell membranes. As a result, cells in the male genital tract produce mucus that is abnormally thick and sticky. This mucus clogs the vas deferens as they are forming, causing them to deteriorate before birth. In instances of congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens without a mutation in the CFTR gene, the cause of this condition is often unknown.

       "  'answer': 'Congenital hyperinsulinism is caused by mutations in genes that regulate the release secretion of insulin, which is produced by beta cells in the pancreas. Insulin clears excess sugar in the form of glucose from the bloodstream by passing glucose into cells to be used as energy. Gene mutations that cause congenital hyperinsulinism lead to over secretion of insulin from beta cells. Normally, insulin is secreted in response to the amount of glucose in the bloodstream when glucose levels rise, so does insulin secretion. However, in people with congenital hyperinsulinism, insulin is secreted from beta cells regardless of the amount of glucose present in the blood. This excessive secretion of insulin results in glucose being rapidly removed from the bloodstream and passed into tissues such as muscle, liver, and fat. A lack of glucose in the blood results in frequent states of hypoglycemia in people with congenital hyperinsulinism. Insufficient blood glucose also deprives the brain of its primary source of fuel. Mutations in at least nine genes have been found to cause congenital hyperinsulinism. Mutations in the ABCC8 gene are the most common known cause of the disorder. They account for this condition in approximately 40 percent of affected individuals. Less frequently, mutations in the KCNJ11 gene have been found in people with congenital hyperinsulinism. Mutations in each of the other genes associated with this condition account for only a small percentage of cases. In approximately half of people with congenital hyperinsulinism, the cause is unknown.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Congenital hyperinsulinism can have different inheritance patterns, usually depending on the form of the condition. At least two forms of the condition have been identified. The most common form is the diffuse form, which occurs when all of the beta cells in the pancreas secrete too much insulin. The focal form of congenital hyperinsulinism occurs when only some of the beta cells over secrete insulin. Most often, the diffuse form of congenital hyperinsulinism is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition. Less frequently, the diffuse form is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. The inheritance of the focal form of congenital hyperinsulinism is more complex. For most genes, both copies are turned on active in all cells, but for a small subset of genes, one of the two copies is turned off inactive . Most people with the focal form of this condition inherit one copy of the mutated, inactive gene from their unaffected father. During embryonic development, a mutation occurs in the other, active copy of the gene. This second mutation is found within only some cells in the pancreas. As a result, some pancreatic beta cells have abnormal insulin secretion, while other beta cells function normally.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter is a progressive disorder that mainly affects the brain and spinal cord central nervous system . This disorder causes deterioration of the central nervous system s white matter, which consists of nerve fibers covered by myelin. Myelin is the fatty substance that insulates and protects nerves. In most cases, people with leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter show no signs or symptoms of the disorder at birth. Affected children may have slightly delayed development of motor skills such as crawling or walking. During early childhood, most affected individuals begin to develop motor symptoms, including abnormal muscle stiffness spasticity and difficulty with coordinating movements ataxia . There may also be some deterioration of mental functioning, but this is not usually as pronounced as the motor symptoms. Some affected females may have abnormal development of the ovaries ovarian dysgenesis . Specific changes in the brain as seen using magnetic resonance imaging MRI are characteristic of leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter, and may be visible before the onset of symptoms. While childhood onset is the most common form of leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter, some severe forms are apparent at birth. A severe, early onset form seen among the Cree and Chippewayan populations of Quebec and Manitoba is called Cree leukoencephalopathy. Milder forms may not become evident until adolescence or adulthood, when behavioral or psychiatric problems may be the first signs of the disease. Some females with milder forms of leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter who survive to adolescence exhibit ovarian dysfunction. This variant of the disorder is called ovarioleukodystrophy. Progression of leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter is generally uneven, with periods of relative stability interrupted by episodes of rapid decline. People with this disorder are particularly vulnerable to stresses such as infection, mild head trauma or other injury, or even extreme fright. These stresses may trigger the first symptoms of the condition or worsen existing symptoms, and can cause affected individuals to become lethargic or comatose.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mutations in the EIF2B1, EIF2B2, EIF2B3, EIF2B4, and EIF2B5 genes cause leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter. The EIF2B1, EIF2B2, EIF2B3, EIF2B4 and EIF2B5 genes provide instructions for making the five parts subunits of a protein called eIF2B. The eIF2B protein helps regulate overall protein production synthesis in the cell by interacting with another protein, eIF2. The eIF2 protein is called an initiation factor because it is involved in starting initiating protein synthesis. Proper regulation of protein synthesis is vital for ensuring that the correct levels of protein are available for the cell to cope with changing conditions. For example, cells must synthesize protein much faster if they are multiplying than if they are in a resting state. Mutations have been identified in all five of the genes from which the eIF2B protein is produced, although most of these mutations about 65 percent occur in the EIF2B5 gene. These mutations cause partial loss of eIF2B function in various ways. For example, they may impair the ability of one of the protein subunits to form a complex with the others, or make it more difficult for the protein to attach to the initiation factor. Partial loss of eIF2B function makes it more difficult for the body s cells to regulate protein synthesis and deal with changing conditions and stress. Researchers believe that cells in the white matter may be particularly affected by an abnormal response to stress, resulting in the signs and symptoms of leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Leber hereditary optic neuropathy LHON is an inherited form of vision loss. Although this condition usually begins in a person s teens or twenties, rare cases may appear in early childhood or later in adulthood. For unknown reasons, males are affected much more often than females. Blurring and clouding of vision are usually the first symptoms of LHON. These vision problems may begin in one eye or simultaneously in both eyes if vision loss starts in one eye, the other eye is usually affected within several weeks or months. Over time, vision in both eyes worsens with a severe loss of sharpness visual acuity and color vision. This condition mainly affects central vision, which is needed for detailed tasks such as reading, driving, and recognizing faces. Vision loss results from the death of cells in the nerve that relays visual information from the eyes to the brain the optic nerve . Although central vision gradually improves in a small percentage of cases, in most cases the vision loss is profound and permanent. Vision loss is typically the only symptom of LHON however, some families with additional signs and symptoms have been reported. In these individuals, the condition is described as LHON plus. In addition to vision loss, the features of LHON plus can include movement disorders, tremors, and abnormalities of the electrical signals that control the heartbeat cardiac conduction defects . Some affected individuals develop features similar to multiple sclerosis, which is a chronic disorder characterized by muscle weakness, poor coordination, numbness, and a variety of other health problems.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mutations in the MT ND1, MT ND4, MT ND4L, or MT ND6 gene can cause LHON. These genes are found in the DNA of cellular structures called mitochondria, which convert the energy from food into a form that cells can use. Although most DNA is packaged in chromosomes within the nucleus, mitochondria also have a small amount of their own DNA, known as mitochondrial DNA or mtDNA. The genes associated with LHON each provide instructions for making a protein involved in normal mitochondrial function. These proteins are part of a large enzyme complex in mitochondria that helps convert oxygen, fats, and simple sugars to energy. Mutations in any of the genes disrupt this process. It remains unclear how these genetic changes cause the death of cells in the optic nerve and lead to the specific features of LHON. A significant percentage of people with a mutation that causes LHON do not develop any features of the disorder. Specifically, more than 50 percent of males with a mutation and more than 85 percent of females with a mutation never experience vision loss or related health problems. Additional factors may determine whether a person develops the signs and symptoms of this disorder. Environmental factors such as smoking and alcohol use may be involved, although studies have produced conflicting results.

       "  'answer': 'LHON has a mitochondrial pattern of inheritance, which is also known as maternal inheritance. This pattern of inheritance applies to genes contained in mtDNA. Because egg cells, but not sperm cells, contribute mitochondria to the developing embryo, children can only inherit disorders resulting from mtDNA mutations from their mother. These disorders can appear in every generation of a family and can affect both males and females, but fathers do not pass traits associated with changes in mtDNA to their children. Often, people who develop the features of LHON have no family history of the condition. Because a person may carry an mtDNA mutation without experiencing any signs or symptoms, it is hard to predict which members of a family who carry a mutation will eventually develop vision loss or other problems associated with LHON. It is important to note that all females with an mtDNA mutation, even those who do not have any signs or symptoms, will pass the genetic change to their children.',\n",

In complete LCAT deficiency, the clear front surface of the eyes the corneas gradually becomes cloudy.

       "  'answer': 'Complete LCAT deficiency is caused by mutations in the LCAT gene. This gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase LCAT . The LCAT enzyme plays a role in removing cholesterol from the blood and tissues by helping it attach to molecules called lipoproteins, which carry it to the liver. Once in the liver, the cholesterol is redistributed to other tissues or removed from the body. The enzyme has two major functions, called alpha and beta LCAT activity. Alpha LCAT activity helps attach cholesterol to a lipoprotein called high density lipoprotein HDL . Beta LCAT activity helps attach cholesterol to other lipoproteins called very low density lipoprotein VLDL and low density lipoprotein LDL . LCAT gene mutations that cause complete LCAT deficiency either prevent the production of LCAT or impair both alpha LCAT and beta LCAT activity, reducing the enzyme s ability to attach cholesterol to lipoproteins. Impairment of this mechanism for reducing cholesterol in the body leads to cholesterol deposits in the corneas, kidneys, and other tissues and organs. LCAT gene mutations that affect only alpha LCAT activity cause a related disorder called fish eye disease that affects only the corneas.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Lamellar ichthyosis is a condition that mainly affects the skin. Infants with this condition are typically born with a tight, clear sheath covering their skin called a collodion membrane. This membrane usually dries and peels off during the first few weeks of life, and then it becomes obvious that affected babies have scaly skin, and eyelids and lips that are turned outward. People with lamellar ichthyosis typically have large, dark, plate like scales covering their skin on most of their body. Infants with lamellar ichthyosis may develop infections, an excessive loss of fluids dehydration , and respiratory problems. Affected individuals may also have hair loss alopecia , abnormally formed fingernails and toenails nail dystrophy , a decreased ability to sweat hypohidrosis , an increased sensitivity to heat, and a thickening of the skin on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet keratoderma . Less frequently, affected individuals have reddened skin erythema and joint deformities contractures .',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mutations in one of many genes can cause lamellar ichthyosis. These genes provide instructions for making proteins that are found in the outermost layer of the skin the epidermis . The skin abnormalities associated with lamellar ichthyosis disrupt the normal formation of the epidermis, resulting in impaired regulation of body temperature, water retention, and resistance to infections. Mutations in the TGM1 gene are responsible for approximately 90 percent of cases of lamellar ichthyosis. The TGM1 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called transglutaminase 1. This enzyme is involved in the formation of the cornified cell envelope, which is a structure that surrounds skin cells and helps form a protective barrier between the body and its environment. TGM1 gene mutations lead to severely reduced or absent enzyme production, which prevents the formation of the cornified cell envelope. Mutations in other genes associated with lamellar ichthyosis are each responsible for only a small percentage of cases. In some people with lamellar ichthyosis, the cause of the disorder is unknown. Researchers have identified multiple chromosome regions that contain genes that may be associated with lamellar ichthyosis, although the specific genes have not been identified.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Klippel Trenaunay syndrome is a condition that affects the development of blood vessels, soft tissues, and bones. The disorder has three characteristic features a red birthmark called a port wine stain, abnormal overgrowth of soft tissues and bones, and vein malformations. Most people with Klippel Trenaunay syndrome are born with a port wine stain. This type of birthmark is caused by swelling of small blood vessels near the surface of the skin. Port wine stains are typically flat and can vary from pale pink to deep maroon in color. In people with Klippel Trenaunay syndrome, the port wine stain usually covers part of one limb. The affected area may become lighter or darker with age. Occasionally, port wine stains develop small red blisters that break open and bleed easily. Klippel Trenaunay syndrome is also associated with overgrowth of bones and soft tissues beginning in infancy. Usually this abnormal growth is limited to one limb, most often one leg. However, overgrowth can also affect the arms or, rarely, the trunk. The abnormal growth can cause pain, a feeling of heaviness, and reduced movement in the affected area. If the overgrowth causes one leg to be longer than the other, it can also lead to problems with walking. Malformations of veins are the third major feature of Klippel Trenaunay syndrome. These abnormalities include varicose veins, which are swollen and twisted veins near the surface of the skin that often cause pain. Varicose veins usually occur on the sides of the upper legs and calves. Veins deep in the limbs can also be abnormal in people with Klippel Trenaunay syndrome. Malformations of deep veins increase the risk of a type of clot called a deep vein thrombosis DVT . If a DVT travels through the bloodstream and lodges in the lungs, it can cause a life threatening clot known as a pulmonary embolism PE . Complications of Klippel Trenaunay syndrome can include a type of skin infection called cellulitis, swelling caused by a buildup of fluid lymphedema , and internal bleeding from abnormal blood vessels. Less commonly, this condition is also associated with fusion of certain fingers or toes syndactyly or the presence of extra digits polydactyly .',\n",

In some children, the buildup of acids causes the blood to become too acidic ketoacidosis , which can damage the body s tissues and organs. Other signs and symptoms may include involuntary muscle tensing dystonia , weak muscle tone hypotonia , developmental delay, an inability to grow and gain weight at the expected rate failure to thrive , low blood sugar hypoglycemia , and coma. Some affected children have an unusually small head size microcephaly . Other people with CMAMMA do not develop signs and symptoms until adulthood.

       "  'answer': 'Mutations in the ACSF3 gene cause CMAMMA. This gene provides instructions for making an enzyme that plays a role in the formation synthesis of fatty acids. Fatty acids are building blocks used to make fats lipids . The ACSF3 enzyme performs a chemical reaction that converts malonic acid to malonyl CoA, which is the first step of fatty acid synthesis in cellular structures called mitochondria. Based on this activity, the enzyme is classified as a malonyl CoA synthetase. The ACSF3 enzyme also converts methylmalonic acid to methylmalonyl CoA, making it a methylmalonyl CoA synthetase as well. The effects of ACSF3 gene mutations are unknown. Researchers suspect that the mutations lead to altered enzymes that have little or no function. Because the enzyme cannot convert malonic and methylmalonic acids, they build up in the body. Damage to organs and tissues caused by accumulation of these acids may be responsible for the signs and symptoms of CMAMMA, although the mechanisms are unclear.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Steatocystoma multiplex can be caused by mutations in the KRT17 gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein called keratin 17, which is produced in the nails, the hair follicles, and the skin on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. It is also found in the skin s sebaceous glands. Keratin 17 partners with a similar protein called keratin 6b to form networks that provide strength and resilience to the skin, nails, and other tissues. The KRT17 gene mutations that cause steatocystoma multiplex alter the structure of keratin 17, preventing it from forming strong, stable networks within cells. The defective keratin network disrupts the growth and function of cells in the skin and nails, including cells that make up the sebaceous glands. These abnormalities lead to the growth of sebum containing cysts in people with steatocystoma multiplex. However, it is unclear why steatocystomas are typically the only feature of this disorder. Many researchers believe that steatocystoma multiplex is a variant form of a disorder called pachyonychia congenita, which can also result from mutations in the KRT17 gene. Like steatocystoma multiplex, pachyonychia congenita involves the growth of steatocystomas. Pachyonychia congenita is also associated with more severe skin and nail abnormalities not usually found in people with steatocystoma multiplex. In some cases, people with steatocystoma multiplex do not have an identified mutation in the KRT17 gene. The cause of the condition in these individuals is unknown.',\n",

Cartilage is a tough, flexible tissue that makes up much of the skeleton during early development. Most cartilage is later converted to bone, except for the cartilage that continues to cover and protect the ends of bones and is present in the nose and external ears. Type II collagen is essential for the normal development of bones and other connective tissues that form the body s supportive framework. Most mutations in the COL2A1 gene that cause spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia, Strudwick type interfere with the assembly of type II collagen molecules.

The disorder affects red blood cells erythrocytes , which carry oxygen white blood cells leukocytes , which protect the body from infection and platelets thrombocytes , which are involved in blood clotting. Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria affects both sexes equally, and can occur at any age, although it is most often diagnosed in young adulthood. People with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria have sudden, recurring episodes of symptoms paroxysmal symptoms , which may be triggered by stresses on the body, such as infections or physical exertion. During these episodes, red blood cells are prematurely destroyed hemolysis . Affected individuals may pass dark colored urine due to the presence of hemoglobin, the oxygen carrying protein in blood. The abnormal presence of hemoglobin in the urine is called hemoglobinuria. In many, but not all cases, hemoglobinuria is most noticeable in the morning, upon passing urine that has accumulated in the bladder during the night nocturnal . The premature destruction of red blood cells results in a deficiency of these cells in the blood hemolytic anemia , which can cause signs and symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, abnormally pale skin pallor , shortness of breath, and an increased heart rate. People with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria may also be prone to infections due to a deficiency of white blood cells. Abnormal platelets associated with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria can cause problems in the blood clotting process. As a result, people with this disorder may experience abnormal blood clotting thrombosis , especially in large abdominal veins or, less often, episodes of severe bleeding hemorrhage . Individuals with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria are at increased risk of developing cancer in blood forming cells leukemia .

       "  'answer': 'Mutations in the PIGA gene cause paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. The PIGA gene provides instructions for making a protein called phosphatidylinositol glycan class A. This protein takes part in a series of steps that produce a molecule called GPI anchor. GPI anchor attaches many different proteins to the cell membrane, thereby ensuring that these proteins are available when needed at the surface of the cell. Some gene mutations are acquired during a person s lifetime and are present only in certain cells. These changes, which are called somatic mutations, are not inherited. In people with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, somatic mutations of the PIGA gene occur in blood forming cells called hematopoietic stem cells, which are found mainly in the bone marrow. These mutations result in the production of abnormal blood cells. As the abnormal hematopoietic stem cells multiply, increasing numbers of abnormal blood cells are formed, alongside normal blood cells produced by normal hematopoietic stem cells. The premature destruction of red blood cells seen in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria is caused by a component of the immune system called complement. Complement consists of a group of proteins that work together to destroy foreign invaders such as bacteria and viruses. To protect the individual s own cells from being destroyed, this process is tightly controlled by complement regulating proteins. Complement regulating proteins normally protect red blood cells from destruction by complement. In people with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, however, abnormal red blood cells are missing two important complement regulating proteins that need the GPI anchor protein to attach them to the cell membrane. These red blood cells are prematurely destroyed, leading to hemolytic anemia. Research suggests that certain abnormal white blood cells that are also part of the immune system may mistakenly attack normal blood forming cells, in a malfunction called an autoimmune process. In addition, abnormal hematopoietic stem cells in people with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria may be less susceptible than normal cells to a process called apoptosis, which causes cells to self destruct when they are damaged or unneeded. These features of the disorder may increase the proportion of abnormal blood cells in the body. The proportion of abnormal blood cells affects the severity of the signs and symptoms of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, including the risk of hemoglobinuria and thrombosis.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Acute promyelocytic leukemia is a form of acute myeloid leukemia, a cancer of the blood forming tissue bone marrow . In normal bone marrow, hematopoietic stem cells produce red blood cells erythrocytes that carry oxygen, white blood cells leukocytes that protect the body from infection, and platelets thrombocytes that are involved in blood clotting. In acute promyelocytic leukemia, immature white blood cells called promyelocytes accumulate in the bone marrow. The overgrowth of promyelocytes leads to a shortage of normal white and red blood cells and platelets in the body, which causes many of the signs and symptoms of the condition. People with acute promyelocytic leukemia are especially susceptible to developing bruises, small red dots under the skin petechiae , nosebleeds, bleeding from the gums, blood in the urine hematuria , or excessive menstrual bleeding. The abnormal bleeding and bruising occur in part because of the low number of platelets in the blood thrombocytopenia and also because the cancerous cells release substances that cause excessive bleeding. The low number of red blood cells anemia can cause people with acute promyelocytic leukemia to have pale skin pallor or excessive tiredness fatigue . In addition, affected individuals may heal slowly from injuries or have frequent infections due to the loss of normal white blood cells that fight infection. Furthermore, the leukemic cells can spread to the bones and joints, which may cause pain in those areas. Other general signs and symptoms may occur as well, such as fever, loss of appetite, and weight loss. Acute promyelocytic leukemia is most often diagnosed around age 40, although it can be diagnosed at any age.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'The mutation that causes acute promyelocytic leukemia involves two genes, the PML gene on chromosome 15 and the RARA gene on chromosome 17. A rearrangement of genetic material translocation between chromosomes 15 and 17, written as t 15 17 , fuses part of the PML gene with part of the RARA gene. The protein produced from this fused gene is known as PML RAR. This mutation is acquired during a person s lifetime and is present only in certain cells. This type of genetic change, called a somatic mutation, is not inherited. The PML RAR protein functions differently than the protein products of the normal PML and RARA genes. The protein produced from the RARA gene, RAR, is involved in the regulation of gene transcription, which is the first step in protein production. Specifically, this protein helps control the transcription of certain genes important in the maturation differentiation of white blood cells beyond the promyelocyte stage. The protein produced from the PML gene acts as a tumor suppressor, which means it prevents cells from growing and dividing too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way. The PML RAR protein interferes with the normal function of both the PML and the RAR proteins. As a result, blood cells are stuck at the promyelocyte stage, and they proliferate abnormally. Excess promyelocytes accumulate in the bone marrow and normal white blood cells cannot form, leading to acute promyelocytic leukemia. The PML RARA gene fusion accounts for up to 98 percent of cases of acute promyelocytic leukemia. Translocations involving the RARA gene and other genes have been identified in a few cases of acute promyelocytic leukemia.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Achondroplasia is a form of short limbed dwarfism. The word achondroplasia literally means without cartilage formation. Cartilage is a tough but flexible tissue that makes up much of the skeleton during early development. However, in achondroplasia the problem is not in forming cartilage but in converting it to bone a process called ossification , particularly in the long bones of the arms and legs. Achondroplasia is similar to another skeletal disorder called hypochondroplasia, but the features of achondroplasia tend to be more severe. All people with achondroplasia have short stature. The average height of an adult male with achondroplasia is 131 centimeters 4 feet, 4 inches , and the average height for adult females is 124 centimeters 4 feet, 1 inch . Characteristic features of achondroplasia include an average size trunk, short arms and legs with particularly short upper arms and thighs, limited range of motion at the elbows, and an enlarged head macrocephaly with a prominent forehead. Fingers are typically short and the ring finger and middle finger may diverge, giving the hand a three pronged trident appearance. People with achondroplasia are generally of normal intelligence. Health problems commonly associated with achondroplasia include episodes in which breathing slows or stops for short periods apnea , obesity, and recurrent ear infections. In childhood, individuals with the condition usually develop a pronounced and permanent sway of the lower back lordosis and bowed legs. Some affected people also develop abnormal front to back curvature of the spine kyphosis and back pain. A potentially serious complication of achondroplasia is spinal stenosis, which is a narrowing of the spinal canal that can pinch compress the upper part of the spinal cord. Spinal stenosis is associated with pain, tingling, and weakness in the legs that can cause difficulty with walking. Another uncommon but serious complication of achondroplasia is hydrocephalus, which is a buildup of fluid in the brain in affected children that can lead to increased head size and related brain abnormalities.',\n",

The FGFR3 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in the development and maintenance of bone and brain tissue. Two specific mutations in the FGFR3 gene are responsible for almost all cases of achondroplasia. Researchers believe that these mutations cause the FGFR3 protein to be overly active, which interferes with skeletal development and leads to the disturbances in bone growth seen with this disorder.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Otopalatodigital syndrome type 1 is a disorder primarily involving abnormalities in skeletal development. It is a member of a group of related conditions called otopalatodigital spectrum disorders, which also includes otopalatodigital syndrome type 2, frontometaphyseal dysplasia, and Melnick Needles syndrome. In general, these disorders involve hearing loss caused by malformations in the tiny bones in the ears ossicles , problems in the development of the roof of the mouth palate , and skeletal abnormalities involving the fingers and or toes digits . Otopalatodigital syndrome type 1 is usually the mildest of the otopalatodigital spectrum disorders. People with this condition usually have characteristic facial features including wide set and downward slanting eyes prominent brow ridges and a small, flat nose. Affected individuals also have hearing loss and chest deformities. They have abnormalities of the fingers and toes, such as blunt, square shaped spatulate fingertips shortened thumbs and big toes and unusually long second toes. Affected individuals may be born with an opening in the roof of the mouth a cleft palate . They may have mildly bowed limbs, and limited range of motion in some joints. People with otopalatodigital syndrome type 1 may be somewhat shorter than other members of their family. Males with this disorder often have more severe signs and symptoms than do females, who may show only the characteristic facial features.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mutations in the FLNA gene cause otopalatodigital syndrome type 1. The FLNA gene provides instructions for producing the protein filamin A, which helps build the network of protein filaments cytoskeleton that gives structure to cells and allows them to change shape and move. Filamin A binds to another protein called actin, and helps the actin to form the branching network of filaments that make up the cytoskeleton. Filamin A also links actin to many other proteins to perform various functions within the cell. A small number of mutations in the FLNA gene have been identified in people with otopalatodigital syndrome type 1. The mutations all result in changes to the filamin A protein in the region that binds to actin. The mutations responsible for otopalatodigital syndrome type 1 are described as gain of function because they appear to enhance the activity of the filamin A protein or give the protein a new, atypical function. Researchers believe that the mutations may change the way the filamin A protein helps regulate processes involved in skeletal development, but it is not known how changes in the protein relate to the specific signs and symptoms of otopalatodigital syndrome type 1.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'The SBBYS variant of Ohdo syndrome is caused by mutations in the KAT6B gene. This gene provides instructions for making a type of enzyme called a histone acetyltransferase. These enzymes modify histones, which are structural proteins that attach bind to DNA and give chromosomes their shape. By adding a small molecule called an acetyl group to histones, histone acetyltransferases control the activity of certain genes. Little is known about the function of the histone acetyltransferase produced from the KAT6B gene. It appears to regulate genes that are important for early development, including development of the skeleton and nervous system. The mutations that cause the SBBYS variant of Ohdo syndrome likely prevent the production of functional histone acetyltransferase from one copy of the KAT6B gene in each cell. Studies suggest that the resulting shortage of this enzyme impairs the regulation of various genes during early development. However, it is unclear how these changes lead to the specific features of the condition.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Trichothiodystrophy, which is commonly called TTD, is a rare inherited condition that affects many parts of the body. The hallmark of this condition is brittle hair that is sparse and easily broken. Tests show that the hair is lacking sulfur, an element that normally gives hair its strength. The signs and symptoms of trichothiodystrophy vary widely. Mild cases may involve only the hair. More severe cases also cause delayed development, significant intellectual disability, and recurrent infections severely affected individuals may survive only into infancy or early childhood. Mothers of children with trichothiodystrophy may experience problems during pregnancy including pregnancy induced high blood pressure preeclampsia and a related condition called HELLP syndrome that can damage the liver. Babies with trichothiodystrophy are at increased risk of premature birth, low birth weight, and slow growth. Most affected children have short stature compared to others their age. Intellectual disability and delayed development are common, although most affected individuals are highly social with an outgoing and engaging personality. Some have brain abnormalities that can be seen with imaging tests. Trichothiodystrophy is also associated with recurrent infections, particularly respiratory infections, which can be life threatening. Other features of trichothiodystrophy can include dry, scaly skin ichthyosis abnormalities of the fingernails and toenails clouding of the lens in both eyes from birth congenital cataracts poor coordination and skeletal abnormalities. About half of all people with trichothiodystrophy have a photosensitive form of the disorder, which causes them to be extremely sensitive to ultraviolet UV rays from sunlight. They develop a severe sunburn after spending just a few minutes in the sun. However, for reasons that are unclear, they do not develop other sun related problems such as excessive freckling of the skin or an increased risk of skin cancer. Many people with trichothiodystrophy report that they do not sweat.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Most cases of the photosensitive form of trichothiodystrophy result from mutations in one of three genes ERCC2, ERCC3, or GTF2H5. The proteins produced from these genes work together as part of a group of proteins called the general transcription factor IIH TFIIH complex. This complex is involved in the repair of DNA damage, which can be caused by UV radiation from the sun. The TFIIH complex also plays an important role in gene transcription, which is the first step in protein production. Mutations in the ERCC2, ERCC3, or GTF2H5 genes reduce the amount of TFIIH complex within cells, which impairs both DNA repair and gene transcription. An inability to repair DNA damage probably underlies the sun sensitivity in affected individuals. Studies suggest that many of the other features of trichothiodystrophy may result from problems with the transcription of genes needed for normal development before and after birth. Mutations in at least one gene, MPLKIP, have been reported to cause a non photosensitive form of trichothiodystrophy. Mutations in this gene account for fewer than 20 percent of all cases of non photosensitive trichothiodystrophy. Little is known about the protein produced from the MPLKIP gene, although it does not appear to be involved in DNA repair. It is unclear how mutations in the MPLKIP gene lead to the varied features of trichothiodystrophy. In some cases, the genetic cause of trichothiodystrophy is unknown.',\n",

Some motor tics are simple and involve only one muscle group. Simple motor tics, such as rapid eye blinking, shoulder shrugging, or nose twitching, are usually the first signs of Tourette syndrome. Motor tics also can be complex involving multiple muscle groups , such as jumping, kicking, hopping, or spinning. Vocal tics, which generally appear later than motor tics, also can be simple or complex. Simple vocal tics include grunting, sniffing, and throat clearing. More complex vocalizations include repeating the words of others echolalia or repeating one s own words palilalia . The involuntary use of inappropriate or obscene language coprolalia is possible, but uncommon, among people with Tourette syndrome. In addition to frequent tics, people with Tourette syndrome are at risk for associated problems including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ADHD , obsessive compulsive disorder OCD , anxiety, depression, and problems with sleep.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'A variety of genetic and environmental factors likely play a role in causing Tourette syndrome. Most of these factors are unknown, and researchers are studying risk factors before and after birth that may contribute to this complex disorder. Scientists believe that tics may result from changes in brain chemicals neurotransmitters that are responsible for producing and controlling voluntary movements. Mutations involving the SLITRK1 gene have been identified in a small number of people with Tourette syndrome. This gene provides instructions for making a protein that is active in the brain. The SLITRK1 protein probably plays a role in the development of nerve cells, including the growth of specialized extensions axons and dendrites that allow each nerve cell to communicate with nearby cells. It is unclear how mutations in the SLITRK1 gene can lead to this disorder. Most people with Tourette syndrome do not have a mutation in the SLITRK1 gene. Because mutations have been reported in so few people with this condition, the association of the SLITRK1 gene with this disorder has not been confirmed. Researchers suspect that changes in other genes, which have not been identified, are also associated with Tourette syndrome.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Between 10 and 15 percent of all cases of prion disease are caused by mutations in the PRNP gene. Because they can run in families, these forms of prion disease are classified as familial. Familial prion diseases, which have overlapping signs and symptoms, include familial Creutzfeldt Jakob disease CJD , Gerstmann Strussler Scheinker syndrome GSS , and fatal familial insomnia FFI . The PRNP gene provides instructions for making a protein called prion protein PrP . Although the precise function of this protein is unknown, researchers have proposed roles in several important processes. These include the transport of copper into cells, protection of brain cells neurons from injury neuroprotection , and communication between neurons. In familial forms of prion disease, PRNP gene mutations result in the production of an abnormally shaped protein, known as PrPSc, from one copy of the gene. In a process that is not fully understood, PrPSc can attach bind to the normal protein PrPC and promote its transformation into PrPSc. The abnormal protein builds up in the brain, forming clumps that damage or destroy neurons. The loss of these cells creates microscopic sponge like holes vacuoles in the brain, which leads to the signs and symptoms of prion disease. The other 85 to 90 percent of cases of prion disease are classified as either sporadic or acquired. People with sporadic prion disease have no family history of the disease and no identified mutation in the PRNP gene. Sporadic disease occurs when PrPC spontaneously, and for unknown reasons, is transformed into PrPSc. Sporadic forms of prion disease include sporadic Creutzfeldt Jakob disease sCJD , sporadic fatal insomnia sFI , and variably protease sensitive prionopathy VPSPr . Acquired prion disease results from exposure to PrPSc from an outside source. For example, variant Creutzfeldt Jakob disease vCJD is a type of acquired prion disease in humans that results from eating beef products containing PrPSc from cattle with prion disease. In cows, this form of the disease is known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy BSE or, more commonly, mad cow disease. Another example of an acquired human prion disease is kuru, which was identified in the South Fore population in Papua New Guinea. The disorder was transmitted when individuals ate affected human tissue during cannibalistic funeral rituals. Rarely, prion disease can be transmitted by accidental exposure to PrPSc contaminated tissues during a medical procedure. This type of prion disease, which accounts for 1 to 2 percent of all cases, is classified as iatrogenic.',\n",

The signs and symptoms of this disorder usually become apparent in mid to late adulthood, most often in a person s 60s. Most people with progressive supranuclear palsy survive 5 to 9 years after the disease first appears, although a few affected individuals have lived for more than a decade. Loss of balance and frequent falls are the most common early signs of progressive supranuclear palsy. Affected individuals have problems with walking, including poor coordination and an unsteady, lurching gait. Other movement abnormalities develop as the disease progresses, including unusually slow movements bradykinesia , clumsiness, and stiffness of the trunk muscles. These problems worsen with time, and most affected people ultimately require wheelchair assistance. Progressive supranuclear palsy is also characterized by abnormal eye movements, which typically develop several years after the other movement problems first appear. Restricted up and down eye movement vertical gaze palsy is a hallmark of this disease. Other eye movement problems include difficulty opening and closing the eyelids, infrequent blinking, and pulling back retraction of the eyelids. These abnormalities can lead to blurred vision, an increased sensitivity to light photophobia , and a staring gaze. Additional features of progressive supranuclear palsy include slow and slurred speech dysarthria and trouble swallowing dysphagia . Most affected individuals also experience changes in personality and behavior, such as a general loss of interest and enthusiasm apathy . They develop problems with cognition, including difficulties with attention, planning, and problem solving.

       "  'answer': 'In most cases, the genetic cause of progressive supranuclear palsy is unknown. Rarely, the disease results from mutations in the MAPT gene. Certain normal variations polymorphisms in the MAPT gene have also been associated with an increased risk of developing progressive supranuclear palsy. The MAPT gene provides instructions for making a protein called tau. This protein is found throughout the nervous system, including in nerve cells neurons in the brain. It is involved in assembling and stabilizing microtubules, which are rigid, hollow fibers that make up the cell s structural framework the cytoskeleton . Microtubules help cells maintain their shape, assist in the process of cell division, and are essential for the transport of materials within cells. The signs and symptoms of progressive supranuclear palsy appear to be related to abnormalities in the tau protein. In people with MAPT gene mutations, genetic changes disrupt the protein s normal structure and function. However, abnormal tau is also found in affected individuals without MAPT gene mutations. The defective tau protein assembles into abnormal clumps within neurons and other brain cells, although it is unclear what effect these clumps have on cell function and survival. Progressive supranuclear palsy is characterized by the gradual death of brain cells, particularly in structures deep within the brain that are essential for coordinating movement. This loss of brain cells underlies the movement abnormalities and other features of progressive supranuclear palsy. This condition is one of several related diseases known as tauopathies, which are characterized by an abnormal buildup of tau in the brain. Researchers suspect that other genetic and environmental factors also contribute to progressive supranuclear palsy. For example, the disease has been linked to genetic changes on chromosome 1 and chromosome 11. However, the specific genes involved have not been identified.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Liddle syndrome is caused by mutations in the SCNN1B or SCNN1G gene. Each of these genes provides instructions for making a piece subunit of a protein complex called the epithelial sodium channel ENaC . These channels are found at the surface of certain cells called epithelial cells in many tissues of the body, including the kidneys, where the channels transport sodium into cells. In the kidney, ENaC channels open in response to signals that sodium levels in the blood are too low, which allows sodium to flow into cells. From the kidney cells, this sodium is returned to the bloodstream a process called reabsorption rather than being removed from the body in urine. Mutations in the SCNN1B or SCNN1G gene change the structure of the respective ENaC subunit. The changes alter a region of the subunit that is involved in signaling for its breakdown degradation when it is no longer needed. As a result of the mutations, the subunit proteins are not degraded, and more ENaC channels remain at the cell surface. The increase in channels at the cell surface abnormally increases the reabsorption of sodium followed by water , which leads to hypertension. Reabsorption of sodium into the blood is linked with removal of potassium from the blood, so excess sodium reabsorption leads to hypokalemia.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Cerebral autosomal recessive arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy, commonly known as CARASIL, is an inherited condition that causes stroke and other impairments. Abnormalities affecting the brain and other parts of the nervous system become apparent in an affected person s twenties or thirties. Often, muscle stiffness spasticity in the legs and problems with walking are the first signs of the disorder. About half of affected individuals have a stroke or similar episode before age 40. As the disease progresses, most people with CARASIL also develop mood and personality changes, a decline in thinking ability dementia , memory loss, and worsening problems with movement. Other characteristic features of CARASIL include premature hair loss alopecia and attacks of low back pain. The hair loss often begins during adolescence and is limited to the scalp. Back pain, which develops in early to mid adulthood, results from the breakdown degeneration of the discs that separate the bones of the spine vertebrae from one another. The signs and symptoms of CARASIL worsen slowly with time. Over the course of several years, affected individuals become less able to control their emotions and communicate with others. They increasingly require help with personal care and other activities of daily living after a few years, they become unable to care for themselves. Most affected individuals die within a decade after signs and symptoms first appear, although few people with the disease have survived for 20 to 30 years.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'CARASIL is caused by mutations in the HTRA1 gene. This gene provides instructions for making an enzyme that is found in many of the body s organs and tissues. One of the major functions of the HTRA1 enzyme is to regulate signaling by proteins in the transforming growth factor beta TGF family. TGF signaling is essential for many critical cell functions. It also plays an important role in the formation of new blood vessels angiogenesis . In people with CARASIL, mutations in the HTRA1 gene prevent the effective regulation of TGF signaling. Researchers suspect that abnormally increased TGF signaling alters the structure of small blood vessels, particularly in the brain. These blood vessel abnormalities described as arteriopathy greatly increase the risk of stroke and lead to the death of nerve cells neurons in many areas of the brain. Dysregulation of TGF signaling may also underlie the hair loss and back pain seen in people with CARASIL, although the relationship between abnormal TGF signaling and these features is less clear.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Charcot Marie Tooth disease is a group of progressive disorders that affect the peripheral nerves. Peripheral nerves connect the brain and spinal cord to muscles and to sensory cells that detect sensations such as touch, pain, heat, and sound. Damage to the peripheral nerves can result in loss of sensation and wasting atrophy of muscles in the feet, legs, and hands. Charcot Marie Tooth disease usually becomes apparent in adolescence or early adulthood, but onset may occur anytime from early childhood through late adulthood. Symptoms of Charcot Marie Tooth disease vary in severity, even among members of the same family. Some people never realize they have the disorder, but most have a moderate amount of physical disability. A small percentage of people experience severe weakness or other problems which, in rare cases, can be life threatening. In most affected individuals, however, Charcot Marie Tooth disease does not affect life expectancy. Typically, the earliest symptoms of Charcot Marie Tooth disease involve balance difficulties, clumsiness, and muscle weakness in the feet. Affected individuals may have foot abnormalities such as high arches pes cavus , flat feet pes planus , or curled toes hammer toes . They often have difficulty flexing the foot or walking on the heel of the foot. These difficulties may cause a higher than normal step or gait and increase the risk of ankle injuries and tripping. As the disease progresses, muscles in the lower legs usually weaken, but leg and foot problems rarely require the use of a wheelchair. Affected individuals may also develop weakness in the hands, causing difficulty with daily activities such as writing, fastening buttons, and turning doorknobs. People with this disorder typically experience a decreased sensitivity to touch, heat, and cold in the feet and lower legs, but occasionally feel aching or burning sensations. In some cases, affected individuals experience gradual hearing loss, deafness, or loss of vision. There are several types of Charcot Marie Tooth disease. Type 1 Charcot Marie Tooth disease CMT1 is characterized by abnormalities in myelin, the fatty substance that covers nerve cells, protecting them and helping to conduct nerve impulses. These abnormalities slow the transmission of nerve impulses. Type 2 Charcot Marie Tooth disease CMT2 is characterized by abnormalities in the fiber, or axon, that extends from a nerve cell body and transmits nerve impulses. These abnormalities reduce the strength of the nerve impulse. Type 4 Charcot Marie Tooth disease CMT4 affects either the axon or myelin and is distinguished from the other types by its pattern of inheritance. In intermediate forms of Charcot Marie Tooth disease, the nerve impulses are both slowed and reduced in strength, probably due to abnormalities in both axons and myelin. Type X Charcot Marie Tooth disease CMTX is caused by mutations in a gene on the X chromosome, one of the two sex chromosomes. Within the various types of Charcot Marie Tooth disease, subtypes such as CMT1A, CMT1B, CMT2A, CMT4A, and CMTX1 are distinguished by the specific gene that is altered. Sometimes other, more historical names are used to describe this disorder. For example, Roussy Levy syndrome is a form of Charcot Marie Tooth disease defined by the additional feature of rhythmic shaking tremors . Dejerine Sottas syndrome is a term sometimes used to describe a severe, early childhood form of Charcot Marie Tooth disease it is also sometimes called Charcot Marie Tooth disease type 3 CMT3 . Depending on the specific gene that is altered, this severe, early onset form of the disorder may also be classified as CMT1 or CMT4. CMTX5 is also known as Rosenberg Chutorian syndrome. Some researchers believe that this condition is not actually a form of Charcot Marie Tooth disease. Instead, they classify it as a separate disorder characterized by peripheral nerve problems, deafness, and vision loss.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Charcot Marie Tooth disease is caused by mutations in many different genes. These genes provide instructions for making proteins that are involved in the function of peripheral nerves in the feet, legs, and hands. The gene mutations that cause Charcot Marie Tooth disease affect the function of the proteins in ways that are not fully understood however, they likely impair axons, which transmit nerve impulses, or affect the specialized cells that produce myelin. As a result, peripheral nerve cells slowly lose the ability to stimulate the muscles and to transmit sensory signals to the brain. The list of genes associated with Charcot Marie Tooth disease continues to grow as researchers study this disorder. Different mutations within a particular gene may cause signs and symptoms of differing severities or lead to different types of Charcot Marie Tooth disease. CMT1 is caused by mutations in the following genes PMP22 CMT1A and CMT1E , MPZ CMT1B , LITAF CMT1C , EGR2 CMT1D , and NEFL CMT1F . CMT2 can result from alterations in many genes, including MFN2 and KIF1B CMT2A RAB7A CMT2B LMNA CMT2B1 TRPV4 CMT2C BSCL2 and GARS CMT2D NEFL CMT2E HSPB1 CMT2F MPZ CMT2I and CMT2J GDAP1 CMT2K and HSPB8 CMT2L . Certain DNM2 gene mutations also cause a form of CMT2. CMT4 is caused by mutations in the following genes GDAP1 CMT4A , MTMR2 CMT4B1 , SBF2 CMT4B2 , SH3TC2 CMT4C , NDRG1 CMT4D , EGR2 CMT4E , PRX CMT4F , FGD4 CMT4H , and FIG4 CMT4J . Intermediate forms of the disorder can be caused by alterations in genes including DNM2, MPZ, YARS, and GDAP1. CMTX is caused by mutations in genes including GJB1 CMTX1 and PRPS1 CMTX5 . Mutations in additional genes, some of which have not been identified, also cause various forms of Charcot Marie Tooth disease.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'The pattern of inheritance varies with the type of Charcot Marie Tooth disease. CMT1, most cases of CMT2, and most intermediate forms are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. This pattern of inheritance means that one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In most cases, an affected person has one affected parent. CMT4, a few CMT2 subtypes, and some intermediate forms are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. Most often, the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but do not show signs and symptoms of the condition. CMTX is inherited in an X linked dominant pattern. A condition is considered X linked if the mutated gene that causes the disorder is located on the X chromosome. The inheritance is dominant if one copy of the altered gene is sufficient to cause the condition. In most cases, affected males, who have the alteration on their only copy of the X chromosome, experience more severe symptoms of the disorder than females, who have two X chromosomes. A characteristic of X linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass X linked traits to their sons. All daughters of affected men will have one altered X chromosome, but they may only have mild symptoms of the disorder. Some cases of Charcot Marie Tooth disease result from a new mutation and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Maffucci syndrome is a disorder that primarily affects the bones and skin. It is characterized by multiple enchondromas, which are noncancerous benign growths of cartilage that develop within the bones. These growths most commonly occur in the limb bones, especially in the bones of the hands and feet however, they may also occur in the skull, ribs, and bones of the spine vertebrae . Enchondromas may result in severe bone deformities, shortening of the limbs, and fractures. The signs and symptoms of Maffucci syndrome may be detectable at birth, although they generally do not become apparent until around the age of 5. Enchondromas develop near the ends of bones, where normal growth occurs, and they frequently stop forming after affected individuals stop growing in early adulthood. As a result of the bone deformities associated with Maffucci syndrome, people with this disorder generally have short stature and underdeveloped muscles. Maffucci syndrome is distinguished from a similar disorder that involves enchondromas Ollier disease by the presence of red or purplish growths in the skin consisting of tangles of abnormal blood vessels hemangiomas . In addition to hemangiomas, individuals with Maffucci syndrome occasionally also have lymphangiomas, which are masses made up of the thin tubes that carry lymph fluid lymphatic vessels . These growths may appear anywhere on the body. Although the enchondromas associated with Maffucci syndrome start out as benign, they may become cancerous malignant . In particular, affected individuals may develop bone cancers called chondrosarcomas, especially in the skull. People with Maffucci syndrome also have an increased risk of other cancers, such as ovarian or liver cancer. People with Maffucci syndrome usually have a normal lifespan, and intelligence is unaffected. The extent of their physical impairment depends on their individual skeletal deformities, but in most cases they have no major limitations in their activities.',\n",

These genes provide instructions for making enzymes called isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and isocitrate dehydrogenase 2, respectively. These enzymes convert a compound called isocitrate to another compound called 2 ketoglutarate. This reaction also produces a molecule called NADPH, which is necessary for many cellular processes. IDH1 or IDH2 gene mutations cause the enzyme produced from the respective gene to take on a new, abnormal function. Although these mutations have been found in some cells of enchondromas and hemangiomas in people with Maffucci syndrome, the relationship between the mutations and the signs and symptoms of the disorder is not well understood. Mutations in other genes may also account for some cases of Maffucci syndrome.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mutations in the MT TL1, MT TK, or MT TE gene cause MIDD. These genes are found in mitochondrial DNA, which is part of cellular structures called mitochondria. Although most DNA is packaged in chromosomes within the cell nucleus, mitochondria also have a small amount of their own DNA known as mitochondrial DNA or mtDNA . The MT TL1, MT TK, and MT TE genes provide instructions for making molecules called transfer RNAs tRNAs , which are chemical cousins of DNA. These molecules help assemble protein building blocks amino acids into functioning proteins. The MT TL1 gene provides instructions for making a specific form of tRNA that is designated as tRNALeu UUR . During protein assembly, this molecule attaches to the amino acid leucine Leu and inserts it into the appropriate locations in the growing protein. Similarly, the protein produced from the MT TK gene, called tRNALys, attaches to the amino acid lysine Lys and inserts it into proteins being assembled. Also, the protein produced from the MT TE gene, called tRNAGlu, attaches to the amino acid glutamic acid Glu and adds it to growing proteins. These tRNA molecules are present only in mitochondria, and they help assemble proteins that are involved in producing energy for cells. In certain cells in the pancreas called beta cells, mitochondria also play a role in controlling the amount of sugar glucose in the bloodstream. In response to high glucose levels, mitochondria help trigger the release of insulin, which stimulates cells to take up glucose from the blood. Mutations in the MT TL1, MT TK, or MT TE gene reduce the ability of tRNA to add amino acids to growing proteins, which slows protein production in mitochondria and impairs their functioning. Researchers believe that the disruption of mitochondrial function lessens the ability of mitochondria to help trigger insulin release. In people with this condition, diabetes results when the beta cells do not produce enough insulin to regulate blood sugar effectively. Researchers have not determined how the mutations lead to hearing loss or the other features of MIDD.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'MIDD is inherited in a mitochondrial pattern, which is also known as maternal inheritance. This pattern of inheritance applies to genes contained in mtDNA. Because egg cells, but not sperm cells, contribute mitochondria to the developing embryo, children can only inherit disorders resulting from mtDNA mutations from their mother. These disorders can appear in every generation of a family and can affect both males and females, but fathers do not pass traits associated with changes in mtDNA to their children. Most of the body s cells contain thousands of mitochondria, each with one or more copies of mtDNA. These cells can have a mix of mitochondria containing mutated and unmutated DNA heteroplasmy .

       "  'answer': '22q11.2 deletion syndrome which is also known by several other names, listed below is a disorder caused by the deletion of a small piece of chromosome 22. The deletion occurs near the middle of the chromosome at a location designated q11.2. 22q11.2 deletion syndrome has many possible signs and symptoms that can affect almost any part of the body. The features of this syndrome vary widely, even among affected members of the same family. Common signs and symptoms include heart abnormalities that are often present from birth, an opening in the roof of the mouth a cleft palate , and distinctive facial features. People with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome often experience recurrent infections caused by problems with the immune system, and some develop autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis and Graves disease in which the immune system attacks the body s own tissues and organs. Affected individuals may also have breathing problems, kidney abnormalities, low levels of calcium in the blood which can result in seizures , a decrease in blood platelets thrombocytopenia , significant feeding difficulties, gastrointestinal problems, and hearing loss. Skeletal differences are possible, including mild short stature and, less frequently, abnormalities of the spinal bones. Many children with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome have developmental delays, including delayed growth and speech development, and learning disabilities. Later in life, they are at an increased risk of developing mental illnesses such as schizophrenia, depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorder. Additionally, affected children are more likely than children without 22q11.2 deletion syndrome to have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ADHD and developmental conditions such as autism spectrum disorders that affect communication and social interaction. Because the signs and symptoms of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome are so varied, different groupings of features were once described as separate conditions. Doctors named these conditions DiGeorge syndrome, velocardiofacial syndrome also called Shprintzen syndrome , and conotruncal anomaly face syndrome. In addition, some children with the 22q11.2 deletion were diagnosed with the autosomal dominant form of Opitz G BBB syndrome and Cayler cardiofacial syndrome. Once the genetic basis for these disorders was identified, doctors determined that they were all part of a single syndrome with many possible signs and symptoms. To avoid confusion, this condition is usually called 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, a description based on its underlying genetic cause.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Most people with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome are missing a sequence of about 3 million DNA building blocks base pairs on one copy of chromosome 22 in each cell. This region contains 30 to 40 genes, many of which have not been well characterized. A small percentage of affected individuals have shorter deletions in the same region. This condition is described as a contiguous gene deletion syndrome because it results from the loss of many genes that are close together. Researchers are working to identify all of the genes that contribute to the features of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. They have determined that the loss of a particular gene on chromosome 22, TBX1, is probably responsible for many of the syndrome s characteristic signs such as heart defects, a cleft palate, distinctive facial features, hearing loss, and low calcium levels . Some studies suggest that a deletion of this gene may contribute to behavioral problems as well. The loss of another gene, COMT, in the same region of chromosome 22 may also help explain the increased risk of behavioral problems and mental illness. The loss of additional genes in the deleted region likely contributes to the varied features of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mutations in the HADH gene cause 3 hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase deficiency. The HADH gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called 3 hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase. Normally, through a process called fatty acid oxidation, several enzymes work in a step wise fashion to break down metabolize fats and convert them to energy. The 3 hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase enzyme is required for a step that metabolizes groups of fats called medium chain fatty acids and short chain fatty acids. Mutations in the HADH gene lead to a shortage of 3 hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase. Medium chain and short chain fatty acids cannot be metabolized properly without sufficient levels of this enzyme. As a result, these fatty acids are not converted to energy, which can lead to characteristic features of 3 hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase deficiency, such as lethargy and hypoglycemia. Medium chain and short chain fatty acids that are not broken down can build up in tissues and damage the liver, heart, and muscles, causing serious complications.

       "  'answer': 'Familial pityriasis rubra pilaris is a rare genetic condition that affects the skin. The name of the condition reflects its major features The term pityriasis refers to scaling rubra means redness and pilaris suggests the involvement of hair follicles in this disorder. Affected individuals have a salmon colored skin rash covered in fine scales. This rash occurs in patches all over the body, with distinct areas of unaffected skin between the patches. Affected individuals also develop bumps called follicular keratoses that occur around hair follicles. The skin on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet often becomes thick, hard, and callused, a condition known as palmoplantar keratoderma. Researchers have distinguished six types of pityriasis rubra pilaris based on the features of the disorder and the age at which signs and symptoms appear. The familial form is usually considered part of type V, which is also known as the atypical juvenile type. People with familial pityriasis rubra pilaris typically have skin abnormalities from birth or early childhood, and these skin problems persist throughout life.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'In most cases of pityriasis rubra pilaris, the cause of the condition is unknown. However, mutations in the CARD14 gene have been found to cause the familial form of the disorder in a few affected families. The CARD14 gene provides instructions for making a protein that turns on activates a group of interacting proteins known as nuclear factor kappa B NF B . NF B regulates the activity of multiple genes, including genes that control the body s immune responses and inflammatory reactions. It also protects cells from certain signals that would otherwise cause them to self destruct undergo apoptosis . The CARD14 protein is found in many of the body s tissues, but it is particularly abundant in the skin. NF B signaling appears to play an important role in regulating inflammation in the skin. Mutations in the CARD14 gene lead to overactivation of NF B signaling, which triggers an abnormal inflammatory response. Researchers are working to determine how these changes lead to the specific features of familial pityriasis rubra pilaris.',\n",

The genital abnormalities in affected males typically include undescended testes cryptorchidism and underdevelopment of the scrotum. Affected females can have an enlarged clitoris clitoromegaly and small labia. Missing or underdeveloped patellae is the most common skeletal abnormality associated with genitopatellar syndrome. Affected individuals may have additional skeletal problems, including joint deformities contractures involving the hips and knees or an inward and upward turning foot called a clubfoot. Bone abnormalities of the spine, ribs, collarbone clavicle , and pelvis have also been reported. Genitopatellar syndrome is also associated with delayed development and intellectual disability, which are often severe. Affected individuals may have an usually small head microcephaly and structural brain abnormalities, including underdeveloped or absent tissue connecting the left and right halves of the brain agenesis of the corpus callosum . People with genitopatellar syndrome may have distinctive facial features such as prominent cheeks and eyes, a nose with a rounded tip or a broad bridge, an unusually small chin micrognathia or a chin that protrudes prognathism , and a narrowing of the head at the temples. Many affected infants have weak muscle tone hypotonia that leads to breathing and feeding difficulties. The condition can also be associated with abnormalities of the heart, kidneys, and teeth.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Genitopatellar syndrome is caused by mutations in the KAT6B gene. This gene provides instructions for making a type of enzyme called a histone acetyltransferase. These enzymes modify histones, which are structural proteins that attach bind to DNA and give chromosomes their shape. By adding a small molecule called an acetyl group to histones, histone acetyltransferases control the activity of certain genes. Little is known about the function of the histone acetyltransferase produced from the KAT6B gene. It appears to regulate genes that are important for early development, including development of the skeleton and nervous system. The mutations that cause genitopatellar syndrome occur near the end of the KAT6B gene and lead to the production of a shortened histone acetyltransferase enzyme. Researchers suspect that the shortened enzyme may function differently than the full length version, altering the regulation of various genes during early development. However, it is unclear how these changes lead to the specific features of genitopatellar syndrome.',\n",

People with this disorder have inadequate levels of an enzyme that helps break down the amino acids lysine, hydroxylysine, and tryptophan, which are building blocks of protein. Excessive levels of these amino acids and their intermediate breakdown products can accumulate and cause damage to the brain, particularly the basal ganglia, which are regions that help control movement. Intellectual disability may also occur. The severity of glutaric acidemia type I varies widely some individuals are only mildly affected, while others have severe problems. In most cases, signs and symptoms first occur in infancy or early childhood, but in a small number of affected individuals, the disorder first becomes apparent in adolescence or adulthood. Some babies with glutaric acidemia type I are born with unusually large heads macrocephaly . Affected individuals may have difficulty moving and may experience spasms, jerking, rigidity, or decreased muscle tone. Some individuals with glutaric acidemia have developed bleeding in the brain or eyes that could be mistaken for the effects of child abuse. Strict dietary control may help limit progression of the neurological damage. Stress caused by infection, fever or other demands on the body may lead to worsening of the signs and symptoms, with only partial recovery.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Fatty acid hydroxylase associated neurodegeneration FAHN is a progressive disorder of the nervous system neurodegeneration characterized by problems with movement and vision that begin during childhood or adolescence. Changes in the way a person walks gait and frequent falls are usually the first noticeable signs of FAHN. Affected individuals gradually develop extreme muscle stiffness spasticity and exaggerated reflexes. They typically have involuntary muscle cramping dystonia , problems with coordination and balance ataxia , or both. The movement problems worsen over time, and some people with this condition eventually require wheelchair assistance. People with FAHN often develop vision problems, which occur due to deterioration atrophy of the nerves that carry information from the eyes to the brain the optic nerves and difficulties with the muscles that control eye movement. Affected individuals may have a loss of sharp vision reduced visual acuity , decreased field of vision, impaired color perception, eyes that do not look in the same direction strabismus , rapid involuntary eye movements nystagmus , or difficulty moving the eyes intentionally supranuclear gaze palsy . Speech impairment dysarthria also occurs in FAHN, and severely affected individuals may lose the ability to speak. People with this disorder may also have difficulty chewing or swallowing dysphagia . In severe cases, they may develop malnutrition and require a feeding tube. The swallowing difficulties can lead to a bacterial lung infection called aspiration pneumonia, which can be life threatening. As the disorder progresses, some affected individuals experience seizures and a decline in intellectual function. Magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the brain in people with FAHN shows signs of iron accumulation, especially in an area of the brain called the globus pallidus, which is involved in regulating movement. Similar patterns of iron accumulation are seen in certain other neurological disorders such as infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy and pantothenate kinase associated neurodegeneration. All these conditions belong to a class of disorders called neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation NBIA .',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mutations in the FA2H gene cause FAHN. The FA2H gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called fatty acid 2 hydroxylase. This enzyme modifies fatty acids, which are building blocks used to make fats lipids . Specifically, fatty acid 2 hydroxylase adds a single oxygen atom to a hydrogen atom at a particular point on a fatty acid to create a 2 hydroxylated fatty acid. Certain 2 hydroxylated fatty acids are important in forming normal myelin myelin is the protective covering that insulates nerves and ensures the rapid transmission of nerve impulses. The part of the brain and spinal cord that contains myelin is called white matter. The FA2H gene mutations that cause FAHN reduce or eliminate the function of the fatty acid 2 hydroxylase enzyme. Reduction of this enzyme s function may result in abnormal myelin that is prone to deterioration demyelination , leading to a loss of white matter leukodystrophy . Leukodystrophy is likely involved in the development of the movement problems and other neurological abnormalities that occur in FAHN. Iron accumulation in the brain is probably also involved, although it is unclear how FA2H gene mutations lead to the buildup of iron. People with FA2H gene mutations and some of the movement problems seen in FAHN were once classified as having a separate disorder called spastic paraplegia 35. People with mutations in this gene resulting in intellectual decline and optic nerve atrophy were said to have a disorder called FA2H related leukodystrophy.

       "  'answer': 'X linked chondrodysplasia punctata 1 is caused by genetic changes involving the ARSE gene. This gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called arylsulfatase E. The function of this enzyme is unknown, although it appears to be important for normal skeletal development and is thought to participate in a chemical pathway involving vitamin K. Evidence suggests that vitamin K normally plays a role in bone growth and maintenance of bone density. Between 60 and 75 percent of males with the characteristic features of X linked chondrodysplasia punctata 1 have a mutation in the ARSE gene. These mutations reduce or eliminate the function of arylsulfatase E. Another 25 percent of affected males have a small deletion of genetic material from the region of the X chromosome that contains the ARSE gene. These individuals are missing the entire gene, so their cells produce no functional arylsulfatase E. Researchers are working to determine how a shortage of arylsulfatase E disrupts the development of bones and cartilage and leads to the characteristic features of X linked chondrodysplasia punctata 1. Some people with the features of X linked chondrodysplasia punctata 1 do not have an identified mutation in the ARSE gene or a deletion involving the gene. Other, as yet unidentified genetic and environmental factors may also be involved in causing this disorder.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Familial lipoprotein lipase deficiency is an inherited condition that disrupts the normal breakdown of fats in the body, resulting in an increase of certain kinds of fats. People with familial lipoprotein lipase deficiency typically develop signs and symptoms before age 10, with one quarter showing symptoms by age 1. The first symptom of this condition is usually abdominal pain, which can vary from mild to severe. The abdominal pain is often due to inflammation of the pancreas pancreatitis . These episodes of pancreatitis begin as sudden acute attacks. If left untreated, pancreatitis can develop into a chronic condition that can damage the pancreas and, in rare cases, be life threatening. Affected individuals may also have an enlarged liver and spleen hepatosplenomegaly . The higher the levels of fat in the body, the larger the liver and spleen become. As fat levels rise, certain white blood cells called macrophages take in excess fat in an attempt to rid fat from the bloodstream. After taking in fat, the macrophages travel to the liver and spleen, where the fatty cells accumulate. Approximately half of individuals with familial lipoprotein lipase deficiency develop small yellow deposits of fat under the skin called eruptive xanthomas. These fat deposits most commonly appear on the trunk, buttocks, knees, and arms. Eruptive xanthomas are small about 1 millimeter in diameter , but individual xanthomas can cluster together to form larger patches. They are generally not painful unless exposed to repeated friction or abrasion. Eruptive xanthomas begin to appear when fat intake increases and levels rise the deposits disappear when fat intake slows and levels decrease. The blood of people with familial lipoprotein lipase deficiency can have a milky appearance due to its high fat content. When fat levels get very high in people with this condition, fats can accumulate in blood vessels in the tissue that lines the back of the eye the retina . The fat buildup gives this tissue a pale pink appearance when examined lipemia retinalis . This fat accumulation does not affect vision and will disappear once fats from the diet are reduced and levels in the body decrease. In people with familial lipoprotein lipase deficiency, increased fat levels can also cause neurological features, such as depression, memory loss, and mild intellectual decline dementia . These problems are remedied when dietary fat levels normalize.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'X linked immunodeficiency with magnesium defect, Epstein Barr virus infection, and neoplasia typically known by the acronym XMEN is a disorder that affects the immune system in males. In XMEN, certain types of immune system cells called T cells are reduced in number or do not function properly. Normally these cells recognize foreign invaders, such as viruses, bacteria, and fungi, and are then turned on activated to attack these invaders in order to prevent infection and illness. Because males with XMEN do not have enough functional T cells, they have frequent infections, such as ear infections, sinus infections, and pneumonia. In particular, affected individuals are vulnerable to the Epstein Barr virus EBV . EBV is a very common virus that infects more than 90 percent of the general population and in most cases goes unnoticed. Normally, after initial infection, EBV remains in the body for the rest of a person s life. However, the virus is generally inactive latent because it is controlled by T cells. In males with XMEN, however, the T cells cannot control the virus, and EBV infection can lead to cancers of immune system cells lymphomas . The word neoplasia in the condition name refers to these lymphomas neoplasia is a general term meaning abnormal growths of tissue. The EBV infection itself usually does not cause any other symptoms in males with XMEN, and affected individuals may not come to medical attention until they develop lymphoma.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'XMEN is caused by mutations in the MAGT1 gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein called a magnesium transporter, which moves charged atoms ions of magnesium Mg2 into certain T cells. Specifically, the magnesium transporter produced from the MAGT1 gene is active in CD8 T cells, which are especially important in controlling viral infections such as the Epstein Barr virus EBV . These cells normally take in magnesium when they detect a foreign invader, and the magnesium is involved in activating the T cell s response. Researchers suggest that magnesium transport may also be involved in the production of another type of T cell called helper T cells CD4 T cells in a gland called the thymus. CD4 T cells direct and assist the functions of the immune system by influencing the activities of other immune system cells. Mutations in the MAGT1 gene impair the magnesium transporter s function, reducing the amount of magnesium that gets into T cells. This magnesium deficiency prevents the efficient activation of the T cells to target EBV and other infections. Uncontrolled EBV infection increases the likelihood of developing lymphoma. Impaired production of CD4 T cells resulting from abnormal magnesium transport likely accounts for the deficiency of this type of T cell in people with XMEN, contributing to the decreased ability to prevent infection and illness.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'X linked hyper IgM syndrome is a condition that affects the immune system and occurs almost exclusively in males. People with this disorder have abnormal levels of proteins called antibodies or immunoglobulins. Antibodies help protect the body against infection by attaching to specific foreign particles and germs, marking them for destruction. There are several classes of antibodies, and each one has a different function in the immune system. Although the name of this condition implies that affected individuals always have high levels of immunoglobulin M IgM , some people have normal levels of this antibody. People with X linked hyper IgM syndrome have low levels of three other classes of antibodies immunoglobulin G IgG , immunoglobulin A IgA , and immunoglobulin E IgE . The lack of certain antibody classes makes it difficult for people with this disorder to fight off infections. Individuals with X linked hyper IgM syndrome begin to develop frequent infections in infancy and early childhood. Common infections include pneumonia, sinus infections sinusitis , and ear infections otitis . Infections often cause these children to have chronic diarrhea and they fail to gain weight and grow at the expected rate failure to thrive . Some people with X linked hyper IgM syndrome have low levels of white blood cells called neutrophils neutropenia . Affected individuals may develop autoimmune disorders, neurologic complications from brain and spinal cord central nervous system infections, liver disease, and gastrointestinal tumors. They also have an increased risk of lymphoma, which is a cancer of immune system cells. The severity of X linked hyper IgM syndrome varies among affected individuals, even among members of the same family. Without treatment, this condition can result in death during childhood or adolescence.',\n",

This gene provides instructions for making a protein called CD40 ligand, which is found on the surface of immune system cells known as T cells. CD40 ligand attaches like a key in a lock to its receptor protein, which is located on the surface of immune system cells called B cells. B cells are involved in the production of antibodies, and initially they are able to make only IgM antibodies. When CD40 ligand and its receptor protein are connected, they trigger a series of chemical signals that instruct the B cell to start making IgG, IgA, or IgE antibodies. CD40 ligand is also necessary for T cells to interact with other cells of the immune system, and it plays a key role in T cell differentiation the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions . Mutations in the CD40LG gene lead to the production of an abnormal CD40 ligand or prevent production of this protein. If CD40 ligand does not attach to its receptor on B cells, these cells cannot produce IgG, IgA, or IgE antibodies. Mutations in the CD40LG gene also impair the T cell s ability to differentiate and interact with other immune system cells.

Tumors that form in the pituitary gland can release excess levels of one or more hormones, although some tumors do not produce hormones nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas . Those that do are typically distinguished by the particular hormones they produce. Prolactinomas are the most common tumors in FIPA. These tumors release prolactin, a hormone that stimulates breast milk production in females. Both women and men can develop prolactinomas, although they are more common in women. In women, these tumors may lead to changes in the menstrual cycle or difficulty becoming pregnant. Some affected women may produce breast milk, even though they are not pregnant or nursing. In men, prolactinomas may cause erectile dysfunction or decreased interest in sex. Rarely, affected men produce breast milk. Large prolactinomas can press on nearby tissues such as the nerves that carry information from the eyes to the brain the optic nerves , causing problems with vision. Another type of tumor called somatotropinoma is also common in FIPA. These tumors release growth hormone also called somatotropin , which promotes growth of the body. Somatotropinomas in children or adolescents can lead to increased height gigantism , because the long bones of their arms and legs are still growing. In adults, growth of the long bones has stopped, but the tumors can cause overgrowth of the hands, feet, and face acromegaly as well as other tissues. Less common tumor types in FIPA include somatolactotropinomas, nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas, adrenocorticotropic hormone secreting tumors which cause a condition known as Cushing disease , thyrotropinomas, and gonadotropinomas. In a family with the condition, affected members can develop the same type of tumor homogenous FIPA or different types heterogenous FIPA . In FIPA, pituitary tumors usually occur at a younger age than sporadic pituitary adenomas, which are not inherited. In general, FIPA tumors are also larger than sporadic pituitary tumors. Often, people with FIPA have macroadenomas, which are tumors larger than 10 millimeters. Familial pituitary adenomas can occur as one of many features in other inherited conditions such as multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 and Carney complex however, in FIPA, the pituitary adenomas are described as isolated because only the pituitary gland is affected.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'FIPA can be caused by mutations in the AIP gene. The function of the protein produced from this gene is not well understood, but it is thought to act as a tumor suppressor, which means it helps prevent cells from growing and dividing in an uncontrolled way. Mutations in the AIP gene alter the protein or reduce the production of functional protein. These changes likely impair the ability of the AIP protein to control the growth and division of cells, allowing pituitary cells to grow and divide unchecked and form a tumor. It is not known why the pituitary gland is specifically affected or why certain types of pituitary adenomas develop. AIP gene mutations account for approximately 15 to 25 percent of cases of FIPA. Somatotropinomas are the most common type of tumor in these individuals. The tumors usually occur at a younger age, often in childhood, and are larger than FIPA tumors not caused by AIP gene mutations. The other genetic causes of FIPA are unknown.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'X linked agammaglobulinemia XLA is a condition that affects the immune system and occurs almost exclusively in males. People with XLA have very few B cells, which are specialized white blood cells that help protect the body against infection. B cells can mature into the cells that produce special proteins called antibodies or immunoglobulins. Antibodies attach to specific foreign particles and germs, marking them for destruction. Individuals with XLA are more susceptible to infections because their body makes very few antibodies. Children with XLA are usually healthy for the first 1 or 2 months of life because they are protected by antibodies acquired before birth from their mother. After this time, the maternal antibodies are cleared from the body, and the affected child begins to develop recurrent infections. In children with XLA, infections generally take longer to get better and then they come back again, even with antibiotic medications. The most common bacterial infections that occur in people with XLA are lung infections pneumonia and bronchitis , ear infections otitis , pink eye conjunctivitis , and sinus infections sinusitis . Infections that cause chronic diarrhea are also common. Recurrent infections can lead to organ damage. People with XLA can develop severe, life threatening bacterial infections however, affected individuals are not particularly vulnerable to infections caused by viruses. With treatment to replace antibodies, infections can usually be prevented, improving the quality of life for people with XLA.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'This condition is inherited in an X linked recessive pattern. The gene associated with this condition is located on the X chromosome, which is one of the two sex chromosomes. In males who have only one X chromosome , one altered copy of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. In females who have two X chromosomes , a mutation would have to occur in both copies of the gene to cause the disorder. Because it is unlikely that females will have two altered copies of this gene, males are affected by X linked recessive disorders much more frequently than females. A characteristic of X linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass X linked traits to their sons. About half of affected individuals do not have a family history of XLA. In most of these cases, the affected person s mother is a carrier of one altered BTK gene. Carriers do not have the immune system abnormalities associated with XLA, but they can pass the altered gene to their children. In other cases, the mother is not a carrier and the affected individual has a new mutation in the BTK gene.',\n",

Affected individuals may also have difficulty breathing, an enlarged liver and spleen hepatosplenomegaly , and developmental delay. Researchers have described seven types of Farber lipogranulomatosis based on their characteristic features. Type 1 is the most common, or classical, form of this condition and is associated with the classic signs of voice, skin, and joint problems that begin a few months after birth. Developmental delay and lung disease also commonly occur. Infants born with type 1 Farber lipogranulomatosis usually survive only into early childhood. Types 2 and 3 generally have less severe signs and symptoms than the other types. Affected individuals have the three classic signs and usually do not have developmental delay. Children with these types of Farber lipogranulomatosis typically live into mid to late childhood. Types 4 and 5 are associated with severe neurological problems. Type 4 usually causes life threatening health problems beginning in infancy due to massive lipid deposits in the liver, spleen, lungs, and immune system tissues. Children with this type typically do not survive past their first year of life. Type 5 is characterized by progressive decline in brain and spinal cord central nervous system function, which causes paralysis of the arms and legs quadriplegia , seizures, loss of speech, involuntary muscle jerks myoclonus , and developmental delay. Children with type 5 Farber lipogranulomatosis survive into early childhood.

       "  'answer': 'Mutations in the ASAH1 gene cause Farber lipogranulomatosis. The ASAH1 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called acid ceramidase. This enzyme is found in cell compartments called lysosomes, which digest and recycle materials. Acid ceramidase breaks down fats called ceramides into a fat called sphingosine and a fatty acid. These two breakdown products are recycled to create new ceramides for the body to use. Ceramides have several roles within cells. For example, they are a component of a fatty substance called myelin that insulates and protects nerve cells. Mutations in the ASAH1 gene lead to severe reduction in acid ceramidase, typically to below 10 percent of normal. As a result, the enzyme cannot break down ceramides properly and they build up in the lysosomes of various cells, including in the lung, liver, colon, muscles used for movement skeletal muscles , cartilage, and bone. The buildup of ceramides along with the reduction of its fatty breakdown products in cells likely causes the signs and symptoms of Farber lipogranulomatosis.

       "  'answer': 'Familial paroxysmal nonkinesigenic dyskinesia is a disorder of the nervous system that causes periods of involuntary movement. Paroxysmal indicates that the abnormal movements come and go over time. Nonkinesigenic means that episodes are not triggered by sudden movement. Dyskinesia broadly refers to involuntary movement of the body. People with familial paroxysmal nonkinesigenic dyskinesia experience episodes of abnormal movement that develop without a known cause or are brought on by alcohol, caffeine, stress, fatigue, menses, or excitement. Episodes are not induced by exercise or sudden movement and do not occur during sleep. An episode is characterized by irregular, jerking or shaking movements that range from mild to severe. In this disorder, the dyskinesias can include slow, prolonged contraction of muscles dystonia small, fast, dance like motions chorea writhing movements of the limbs athetosis and, rarely, flailing movements of the limbs ballismus . Dyskinesias also affect muscles in the trunk and face. The type of abnormal movement varies among affected individuals, even among members of the same family. Individuals with familial paroxysmal nonkinesigenic dyskinesia do not lose consciousness during an episode. Most people do not experience any other neurological symptoms between episodes. Individuals with familial paroxysmal nonkinesigenic dyskinesia usually begin to show signs and symptoms of the disorder during childhood or their early teens. Episodes typically last 1 4 hours, and the frequency of episodes ranges from several per day to one per year. In some affected individuals, episodes occur less often with age.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Generalized arterial calcification of infancy GACI is a disorder affecting the circulatory system that becomes apparent before birth or within the first few months of life. It is characterized by abnormal accumulation of the mineral calcium calcification in the walls of the blood vessels that carry blood from the heart to the rest of the body the arteries . This calcification often occurs along with thickening of the lining of the arterial walls the intima . These changes lead to narrowing stenosis and stiffness of the arteries, which forces the heart to work harder to pump blood. As a result, heart failure may develop in affected individuals, with signs and symptoms including difficulty breathing, accumulation of fluid edema in the extremities, a bluish appearance of the skin or lips cyanosis , severe high blood pressure hypertension , and an enlarged heart cardiomegaly . People with GACI may also have calcification in other organs and tissues, particularly around the joints. In addition, they may have hearing loss or softening and weakening of the bones rickets . Some individuals with GACI also develop features similar to those of another disorder called pseudoxanthoma elasticum PXE . PXE is characterized by the accumulation of calcium and other minerals mineralization in elastic fibers, which are a component of connective tissue. Connective tissue provides strength and flexibility to structures throughout the body. Features characteristic of PXE that also occur in GACI include yellowish bumps called papules on the underarms and other areas of skin that touch when a joint bends flexor areas and abnormalities called angioid streaks affecting tissue at the back of the eye, which can be detected during an eye examination. As a result of the cardiovascular problems associated with GACI, individuals with this condition often do not survive past infancy, with death typically caused by a heart attack or stroke. However, affected individuals who survive their first six months, known as the critical period, can live into adolescence or early adulthood.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'In about two thirds of cases, GACI is caused by mutations in the ENPP1 gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein that helps break down a molecule called adenosine triphosphate ATP , specifically when it is found outside the cell extracellular . Extracellular ATP is quickly broken down into other molecules called adenosine monophosphate AMP and pyrophosphate. Pyrophosphate is important in controlling calcification and other mineralization in the body. Mutations in the ENPP1 gene are thought to result in reduced availability of pyrophosphate, leading to excessive calcification in the body and causing the signs and symptoms of GACI. GACI can also be caused by mutations in the ABCC6 gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein called MRP6, also known as the ABCC6 protein. This protein is found primarily in the liver and kidneys, with small amounts in other tissues such as the skin, stomach, blood vessels, and eyes. MRP6 is thought to transport certain substances across the cell membrane however, the substances have not been identified. Some studies suggest that the MRP6 protein stimulates the release of ATP from cells through an unknown mechanism, allowing it to be broken down into AMP and pyrophosphate and helping to control deposition of calcium and other minerals in the body as described above. Other studies suggest that a substance transported by MRP6 is involved in the breakdown of ATP. This unidentified substance is thought to help prevent mineralization of tissues. Mutations in the ABCC6 gene lead to an absent or nonfunctional MRP6 protein. It is unclear how a lack of properly functioning MRP6 protein leads to GACI. This shortage may impair the release of ATP from cells. As a result, little pyrophosphate is produced, and calcium accumulates in the blood vessels and other tissues affected by GACI. Alternatively, a lack of functioning MRP6 may impair the transport of a substance that would normally prevent mineralization, leading to the abnormal accumulation of calcium characteristic of GACI. Some people with GACI do not have mutations in the ENPP1 or ABCC6 gene. In these affected individuals, the cause of the disorder is unknown.',\n",

       "  'answer': '3 M syndrome is a disorder that causes short stature dwarfism , unusual facial features, and skeletal abnormalities. The name of this condition comes from the initials of three researchers who first identified it Miller, McKusick, and Malvaux. Individuals with 3 M syndrome grow extremely slowly before birth, and this slow growth continues throughout childhood and adolescence. They have low birth weight and length and remain much smaller than others in their family, growing to an adult height of approximately 120 centimeters to 130 centimeters 4 feet to 4 feet 6 inches . Affected individuals have a normally sized head that looks disproportionately large in comparison with their body. The head may be unusually long and narrow in shape dolichocephalic . In addition to short stature, people with 3 M syndrome have a triangle shaped face with a broad, prominent forehead frontal bossing and a pointed chin the middle of the face is less prominent hypoplastic midface . They may have large ears, full eyebrows, an upturned nose with a fleshy tip, a long area between the nose and mouth philtrum , a prominent mouth, and full lips. Affected individuals may have a short, broad neck and chest with prominent shoulder blades and square shoulders. They may have abnormal spinal curvature such as a rounded upper back that also curves to the side kyphoscoliosis or exaggerated curvature of the lower back hyperlordosis . People with 3 M syndrome may also have unusual curving of the fingers clinodactyly , short fifth pinky fingers, prominent heels, and loose joints. Other skeletal abnormalities, such as unusually slender long bones in the arms and legs, tall, narrow spinal bones vertebrae , or slightly delayed bone age may be apparent in x ray images. 3 M syndrome can also affect other body systems. Males with 3 M syndrome may produce reduced amounts of sex hormones hypogonadism and occasionally have the urethra opening on the underside of the penis hypospadias . People with this condition may be at increased risk of developing bulges in blood vessel walls aneurysms in the brain. Intelligence is unaffected by 3 M syndrome, and life expectancy is generally normal. A variant of 3 M syndrome called Yakut short stature syndrome has been identified in an isolated population in Siberia. In addition to having most of the physical features characteristic of 3 M syndrome, people with this form of the disorder are often born with respiratory problems that can be life threatening in infancy.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mutations in the CUL7 gene cause 3 M syndrome. The CUL7 gene provides instructions for making a protein called cullin 7. This protein plays a role in the cell machinery that breaks down degrades unwanted proteins, called the ubiquitin proteasome system. Cullin 7 helps to assemble a complex known as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. This complex tags damaged and excess proteins with molecules called ubiquitin. Ubiquitin serves as a signal to specialized cell structures known as proteasomes, which attach bind to the tagged proteins and degrade them. The ubiquitin proteasome system acts as the cell s quality control system by disposing of damaged, misshapen, and excess proteins. This system also regulates the level of proteins involved in several critical cell activities such as the timing of cell division and growth. Mutations in the CUL7 gene that cause 3 M syndrome disrupt the ability of the cullin 7 protein to bring together the components of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, interfering with the process of tagging other proteins with ubiquitin ubiquitination . It is not known how impaired ubiquitination results in the specific signs and symptoms of 3 M syndrome.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mutations in the SIL1 gene cause Marinesco Sjgren syndrome. The SIL1 gene provides instructions for producing a protein located in a cell structure called the endoplasmic reticulum. Among its many functions, the endoplasmic reticulum folds and modifies newly formed proteins so they have the correct 3 dimensional shape. The SIL1 protein plays a role in the process of protein folding. SIL1 gene mutations result in the production of a protein that has little or no activity. A lack of SIL1 protein is thought to impair protein folding, which could disrupt protein transport and cause proteins to accumulate in the endoplasmic reticulum. This accumulation likely damages and destroys cells in many different tissues, leading to ataxia, myopathy, and the other features of Marinesco Sjgren syndrome. Approximately one third of people with Marinesco Sjgren syndrome do not have identified mutations in the SIL1 gene. In these cases, the cause of the condition is unknown.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Char syndrome is a condition that affects the development of the face, heart, and limbs. It is characterized by a combination of three major features a distinctive facial appearance, a heart defect called patent ductus arteriosus, and hand abnormalities. Most people with Char syndrome have a characteristic facial appearance that includes flattened cheek bones and a flat nasal bridge the area of the nose between the eyes . The tip of the nose is also flat and broad. The eyes are wide set with droopy eyelids ptosis and outside corners that point downward down slanting palpebral fissures . Additional facial differences include a shortened distance between the nose and upper lip a short philtrum , a triangular shaped mouth, and thick, prominent lips. Patent ductus arteriosus is a common heart defect in newborns, and it occurs in most babies with Char syndrome. Before birth, the ductus arteriosus forms a connection between two major arteries the aorta and the pulmonary artery . This connection normally closes shortly after birth, but it remains open in babies with patent ductus arteriosus. If untreated, this heart defect causes infants to breathe rapidly, feed poorly, and gain weight slowly. In severe cases, it can lead to heart failure. People with patent ductus arteriosus also have an increased risk of infection. Hand abnormalities are another feature of Char syndrome. In most people with this condition, the middle section of the fifth pinky finger is shortened or absent. Other abnormalities of the hands and feet have been reported but are less common.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mutations in the TFAP2B gene cause Char syndrome. This gene provides instructions for making a protein known as transcription factor AP 2. A transcription factor is a protein that attaches binds to specific regions of DNA and helps control the activity of particular genes. Transcription factor AP 2 regulates genes that are involved in development before birth. In particular, this protein appears to play a role in the normal formation of structures in the face, heart, and limbs. TFAP2B mutations alter the structure of transcription factor AP 2. Some of these mutations prevent the protein from binding to DNA, while other mutations render it unable to regulate the activity of other genes. A loss of this protein s function disrupts the normal development of several parts of the body before birth, resulting in the major features of Char syndrome.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy, usually called CADASIL, is an inherited condition that causes stroke and other impairments. This condition affects blood flow in small blood vessels, particularly cerebral vessels within the brain. The muscle cells surrounding these blood vessels vascular smooth muscle cells are abnormal and gradually die. In the brain, the resulting blood vessel damage arteriopathy can cause migraines, often with visual sensations or auras, or recurrent seizures epilepsy . Damaged blood vessels reduce blood flow and can cause areas of tissue death infarcts throughout the body. An infarct in the brain can lead to a stroke. In individuals with CADASIL, a stroke can occur at any time from childhood to late adulthood, but typically happens during mid adulthood. People with CADASIL often have more than one stroke in their lifetime. Recurrent strokes can damage the brain over time. Strokes that occur in the subcortical region of the brain, which is involved in reasoning and memory, can cause progressive loss of intellectual function dementia and changes in mood and personality. Many people with CADASIL also develop leukoencephalopathy, which is a change in a type of brain tissue called white matter that can be seen with magnetic resonance imaging MRI . The age at which the signs and symptoms of CADASIL first begin varies greatly among affected individuals, as does the severity of these features. CADASIL is not associated with the common risk factors for stroke and heart attack, such as high blood pressure and high cholesterol, although some affected individuals might also have these health problems.',\n",

By freeing these amino acids, prolidase helps make them available for use in producing proteins that the body needs. Prolidase is also involved in the final step of the breakdown of some proteins obtained through the diet and proteins that are no longer needed in the body. Prolidase is particularly important in the breakdown of collagens, a family of proteins that are rich in proline and hydroxyproline. Collagens are an important part of the extracellular matrix, which is the lattice of proteins and other molecules outside the cell. The extracellular matrix strengthens and supports connective tissues, such as skin, bone, cartilage, tendons, and ligaments. Collagen breakdown occurs during the maintenance remodeling of the extracellular matrix. PEPD gene mutations that cause prolidase deficiency result in the loss of prolidase enzyme activity. It is not well understood how the absence of prolidase activity causes the various signs and symptoms of prolidase deficiency. Researchers have suggested that accumulation of dipeptides that have not been broken down may lead to cell death. When cells die, their contents are released into the surrounding tissue, which could cause inflammation and lead to the skin problems seen in prolidase deficiency. Impaired collagen breakdown during remodeling of the extracellular matrix may also contribute to the skin problems. The intellectual disability that occurs in prolidase deficiency might result from problems in processing neuropeptides, which are brain signaling proteins that are rich in proline. It is unclear how absence of prolidase activity results in the other features of prolidase deficiency.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Progressive external ophthalmoplegia is a condition characterized by weakness of the eye muscles. The condition typically appears in adults between ages 18 and 40. The most common signs and symptoms of progressive external ophthalmoplegia are drooping eyelids ptosis , which can affect one or both eyelids, and weakness or paralysis of the muscles that move the eye ophthalmoplegia . Affected individuals may also have general weakness of the skeletal muscles myopathy , particularly in the neck, arms, or legs. The weakness may be especially noticeable during exercise exercise intolerance . Muscle weakness may also cause difficulty swallowing dysphagia . When the muscle cells of affected individuals are stained and viewed under a microscope, these cells usually appear abnormal. These abnormal muscle cells contain an excess of structures called mitochondria and are known as ragged red fibers. Additionally, a close study of muscle cells may reveal abnormalities in a type of DNA found in mitochondria called mitochondrial DNA mtDNA . Affected individuals often have large deletions of genetic material from mtDNA in muscle tissue. Although muscle weakness is the primary symptom of progressive external ophthalmoplegia, this condition can be accompanied by other signs and symptoms. In these instances, the condition is referred to as progressive external ophthalmoplegia plus PEO . Additional signs and symptoms can include hearing loss caused by nerve damage in the inner ear sensorineural hearing loss , weakness and loss of sensation in the limbs due to nerve damage neuropathy , impaired muscle coordination ataxia , a pattern of movement abnormalities known as parkinsonism, or depression. Progressive external ophthalmoplegia is part of a spectrum of disorders with overlapping signs and symptoms. Similar disorders include other conditions caused by POLG gene mutations, such as ataxia neuropathy spectrum, as well as other mtDNA deletion disorders, such as Kearns Sayre syndrome. Like progressive external ophthalmoplegia, the other conditions in this spectrum can involve weakness of the eye muscles. However, these conditions have many additional features not shared by most people with progressive external ophthalmoplegia.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Progressive external ophthalmoplegia is a condition caused by defects in mitochondria, which are structures within cells that use oxygen to convert the energy from food into a form cells can use. This process is called oxidative phosphorylation. Although most DNA is packaged in chromosomes within the nucleus nuclear DNA , mitochondria also have a small amount of their own DNA, called mitochondrial DNA or mtDNA. Progressive external ophthalmoplegia can result from mutations in several different genes. In some cases, mutations in the MT TL1 gene, which is located in mtDNA, cause progressive external ophthalmoplegia. In other cases, mutations in nuclear DNA are responsible for the condition, particularly mutations in the POLG, SLC25A4, and C10orf2 genes. These genes are critical for mtDNA maintenance. Although the mechanism is unclear, mutations in any of these three genes lead to large deletions of mtDNA, ranging from 2,000 to 10,000 DNA building blocks nucleotides . Researchers have not determined how deletions of mtDNA lead to the specific signs and symptoms of progressive external ophthalmoplegia, although the features of the condition are probably related to impaired oxidative phosphorylation. It has been suggested that eye muscles are commonly affected by mitochondrial defects because they are especially dependent on oxidative phosphorylation for energy.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Progressive external ophthalmoplegia can have different inheritance patterns depending on the gene involved. When this condition is caused by mutations in the MT TL1 gene, it is inherited in a mitochondrial pattern, which is also known as maternal inheritance. This pattern of inheritance applies to genes contained in mtDNA. Because egg cells, but not sperm cells, contribute mitochondria to the developing embryo, children can only inherit disorders resulting from mtDNA mutations from their mother. These disorders can appear in every generation of a family and can affect both males and females, but fathers do not pass traits associated with changes in mtDNA to their children. When the nuclear genes POLG, SLC25A4, or C10orf2 are involved, progressive external ophthalmoplegia is usually inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. Certain mutations in the POLG gene can also cause a form of the condition that is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition. Some mutations in the POLG gene that cause progressive external ophthalmoplegia occur during a person s lifetime and are not inherited. These genetic changes are called somatic mutations.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'COL4A1 related brain small vessel disease is part of a group of conditions called the COL4A1 related disorders. The conditions in this group have a range of signs and symptoms that involve fragile blood vessels. COL4A1 related brain small vessel disease is characterized by weakening of the blood vessels in the brain. Stroke is often the first symptom of this condition, typically occurring in mid adulthood. In affected individuals, stroke is usually caused by bleeding in the brain hemorrhagic stroke rather than a lack of blood flow in the brain ischemic stroke , although either type can occur. Individuals with this condition are at increased risk of having more than one stroke in their lifetime. People with COL4A1 related brain small vessel disease also have leukoencephalopathy, which is a change in a type of brain tissue called white matter that can be seen with magnetic resonance imaging MRI . Affected individuals may also experience seizures and migraine headaches accompanied by visual sensations known as auras. Some people with COL4A1 related brain small vessel disease have an eye abnormality called Axenfeld Rieger anomaly. Axenfeld Rieger anomaly involves underdevelopment and eventual tearing of the colored part of the eye iris and a pupil that is not in the center of the eye. Other eye problems experienced by people with COL4A1 related brain small vessel disease include clouding of the lens of the eye cataract and the presence of arteries that twist and turn abnormally within the light sensitive tissue at the back of the eye arterial retinal tortuosity . Axenfeld Rieger anomaly and cataract can cause impaired vision. Arterial retinal tortuosity can cause episodes of bleeding within the eye following any minor trauma to the eye, leading to temporary vision loss. The severity of the condition varies greatly among affected individuals. Some individuals with COL4A1 related brain small vessel disease do not have any signs or symptoms of the condition.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'As the name suggests, mutations in the COL4A1 gene cause COL4A1 related brain small vessel disease. The COL4A1 gene provides instructions for making one component of a protein called type IV collagen. Type IV collagen molecules attach to each other to form complex protein networks. These protein networks are the main components of basement membranes, which are thin sheet like structures that separate and support cells in many tissues. Type IV collagen networks play an important role in the basement membranes in virtually all tissues throughout the body, particularly the basement membranes surrounding the body s blood vessels vasculature . The COL4A1 gene mutations that cause COL4A1 related brain small vessel disease result in the production of a protein that disrupts the structure of type IV collagen. As a result, type IV collagen molecules cannot attach to each other to form the protein networks in basement membranes. Basement membranes without these networks are unstable, leading to weakening of the tissues that they surround. In people with COL4A1 related brain small vessel disease, the vasculature in the brain weakens, which can lead to blood vessel breakage and stroke.

       "  'answer': 'As the condition name suggests, mutations in the TK2 gene cause TK2 MDS. The TK2 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called thymidine kinase 2 that functions within cell structures called mitochondria, which are found in all tissues. Mitochondria are involved in a wide variety of cellular activities, including energy production chemical signaling and regulation of cell growth, cell division, and cell death. Mitochondria contain their own genetic material, known as mitochondrial DNA mtDNA , which is essential for the normal function of these structures. Thymidine kinase 2 is involved in the production and maintenance of mtDNA. Specifically, this enzyme plays a role in recycling mtDNA building blocks nucleotides so that errors in mtDNA sequencing can be repaired and new mtDNA molecules can be produced. Mutations in the TK2 gene reduce the production or activity of thymidine kinase 2. A decrease in enzyme activity impairs recycling of mtDNA nucleotides, causing a shortage of nucleotides available for the repair and production of mtDNA molecules. A reduction in the amount of mtDNA known as mtDNA depletion impairs mitochondrial function. Greater mtDNA depletion tends to cause more severe signs and symptoms. The muscle cells of people with TK2 MDS have very low amounts of mtDNA, ranging from 5 to 30 percent of normal. Other tissues can have 60 percent of normal to normal amounts of mtDNA. It is unclear why TK2 gene mutations typically affect only muscle tissue, but the high energy demands of muscle cells may make them the most susceptible to cell death when mtDNA is lost and less energy is produced in cells. The brain and the liver also have high energy demands, which may explain why these organs are affected in severe cases of TK2 MDS.',\n",

Hair in affected individuals is described as wooly, brittle, patchy, and easily pulled out. Under a microscope, some strands of hair can be seen to vary in diameter, with thicker and thinner spots. This feature is known as trichorrhexis nodosa.

Studies suggest that getting rid of excess and abnormal mRNA is important for cell growth. Mutations in the TTC37 or SKIV2L gene likely eliminate the function of their respective proteins, which is hypothesized to impair the breakdown of unneeded mRNA. However, it is unknown how these changes could lead to chronic diarrhea and the other features of trichohepatoenteric syndrome.',\n",

In males who have only one X chromosome , one altered copy of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. In females who have two X chromosomes , a mutation would have to occur in both copies of the gene to cause the disorder. Because it is unlikely that females will have two altered copies of this gene, males are affected by X linked recessive disorders much more frequently than females. Females with only one altered copy of the gene in each cell are called carriers. They do not usually experience health problems related to the condition, but they can pass the mutation to their children. Sons who inherit the altered gene will have the condition, while daughters who inherit the altered gene will be carriers.

       "  'answer': 'Achondrogenesis is a group of severe disorders that affect cartilage and bone development. These conditions are characterized by a small body, short limbs, and other skeletal abnormalities. As a result of serious health problems, infants with achondrogenesis usually die before birth, are stillborn, or die soon after birth from respiratory failure. However, some infants have lived for a short time with intensive medical support. Researchers have described at least three forms of achondrogenesis, designated as type 1A, type 1B, and type 2. The types are distinguished by their signs and symptoms, inheritance pattern, and genetic cause. However, types 1A and 1B are often hard to tell apart without genetic testing. Achondrogenesis type 1A, which is also called the Houston Harris type, is the least well understood of the three forms. Affected infants have extremely short limbs, a narrow chest, short ribs that fracture easily, and a lack of normal bone formation ossification in the skull, spine, and pelvis. Achondrogenesis type 1B, also known as the Parenti Fraccaro type, is characterized by extremely short limbs, a narrow chest, and a prominent, rounded abdomen. The fingers and toes are short and the feet may turn inward and upward clubfeet . Affected infants frequently have a soft out pouching around the belly button an umbilical hernia or near the groin an inguinal hernia . Infants with achondrogenesis type 2, which is sometimes called the Langer Saldino type, have short arms and legs, a narrow chest with short ribs, and underdeveloped lungs. This condition is also associated with a lack of ossification in the spine and pelvis. Distinctive facial features include a prominent forehead, a small chin, and, in some cases, an opening in the roof of the mouth a cleft palate . The abdomen is enlarged, and affected infants often have a condition called hydrops fetalis, in which excess fluid builds up in the body before birth.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mutations in the TRIP11, SLC26A2, and COL2A1 genes cause achondrogenesis type 1A, type 1B, and type 2, respectively. The genetic cause of achondrogenesis type 1A was unknown until recently, when researchers discovered that the condition can result from mutations in the TRIP11 gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein called GMAP 210. This protein plays a critical role in the Golgi apparatus, a cell structure in which newly produced proteins are modified so they can carry out their functions. Mutations in the TRIP11 gene prevent the production of functional GMAP 210, which alters the structure and function of the Golgi apparatus. Researchers suspect that cells called chondrocytes in the developing skeleton may be most sensitive to these changes. Chondrocytes give rise to cartilage, a tough, flexible tissue that makes up much of the skeleton during early development. Most cartilage is later converted to bone, except for the cartilage that continues to cover and protect the ends of bones and is present in the nose and external ears. Malfunction of the Golgi apparatus in chondrocytes likely underlies the problems with bone formation in achondrogenesis type 1A. Achondrogenesis type 1B is the most severe of a spectrum of skeletal disorders caused by mutations in the SLC26A2 gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein that is essential for the normal development of cartilage and for its conversion to bone. Mutations in the SLC26A2 gene cause the skeletal problems characteristic of achondrogenesis type 1B by disrupting the structure of developing cartilage, which prevents bones from forming properly. Achondrogenesis type 2 is one of several skeletal disorders that result from mutations in the COL2A1 gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein that forms type II collagen. This type of collagen is found mostly in cartilage and in the clear gel that fills the eyeball the vitreous . It is essential for the normal development of bones and other connective tissues that form the body s supportive framework. Mutations in the COL2A1 gene interfere with the assembly of type II collagen molecules, which prevents bones and other connective tissues from developing properly.',\n",

In people with this condition, osteoporosis is usually recognized in early childhood. It is caused by a shortage of minerals, such as calcium, in bones decreased bone mineral density , which makes the bones brittle and prone to fracture. Affected individuals often have multiple bone fractures, including in the bones that form the spine vertebrae . Multiple fractures can cause collapse of the affected vertebrae compressed vertebrae , abnormal side to side curvature of the spine scoliosis , short stature, and limb deformities. Decreased bone mineral density can also cause softening or thinning of the skull craniotabes . Most affected individuals have impaired vision at birth or by early infancy and are blind by young adulthood. Vision problems are usually caused by one of several eye conditions, grouped together as pseudoglioma, that affect the light sensitive tissue at the back of the eye the retina , although other eye conditions have been identified in affected individuals. Pseudogliomas are so named because, on examination, the conditions resemble an eye tumor known as a retinal glioma.

       "  'answer': 'Paroxysmal extreme pain disorder is a condition characterized by skin redness and warmth flushing and attacks of severe pain in various parts of the body. The area of flushing typically corresponds to the site of the pain. The pain attacks experienced by people with paroxysmal extreme pain disorder usually last seconds to minutes, but in some cases can last hours. These attacks can start as early as infancy. Early in life, the pain is typically concentrated in the lower part of the body, especially around the rectum, and is usually triggered by a bowel movement. Some children may develop constipation, which is thought to be due to fear of triggering a pain attack. Pain attacks in these young children may also be accompanied by seizures, slow heartbeat, or short pauses in breathing apnea . As a person with paroxysmal extreme pain disorder ages, the location of pain changes. Pain attacks switch from affecting the lower body to affecting the head and face, especially the eyes and jaw. Triggers of these pain attacks include changes in temperature such as a cold wind and emotional distress as well as eating spicy foods and drinking cold drinks. Paroxysmal extreme pain disorder is considered a form of peripheral neuropathy because it affects the peripheral nervous system, which connects the brain and spinal cord to muscles and to cells that detect sensations such as touch, smell, and pain.',\n",

Sodium channels transport positively charged sodium atoms sodium ions into cells and play a key role in a cell s ability to generate and transmit electrical signals. NaV1.7 sodium channels are found in nerve cells called nociceptors that transmit pain signals to the spinal cord and brain. The SCN9A gene mutations that cause paroxysmal extreme pain disorder result in NaV1.7 sodium channels that do not close completely when it is turned off, allowing sodium ions to flow abnormally into nociceptors. This increase in sodium ions enhances transmission of pain signals, leading to the pain attacks experienced by people with paroxysmal extreme pain disorder.

       "  'answer': 'Activated PI3K delta syndrome is a disorder that impairs the immune system. Individuals with this condition often have low numbers of white blood cells lymphopenia , particularly B cells and T cells. Normally, these cells recognize and attack foreign invaders, such as viruses and bacteria, to prevent infection. Beginning in childhood, people with activated PI3K delta syndrome develop recurrent infections, particularly in the lungs, sinuses, and ears. Over time, recurrent respiratory tract infections can lead to a condition called bronchiectasis, which damages the passages leading from the windpipe to the lungs bronchi and can cause breathing problems. People with activated PI3K delta syndrome may also have chronic active viral infections, commonly Epstein Barr virus or cytomegalovirus infections. Another possible feature of activated PI3K delta syndrome is abnormal clumping of white blood cells. These clumps can lead to enlarged lymph nodes lymphadenopathy , or the white blood cells can build up to form solid masses nodular lymphoid hyperplasia , usually in the moist lining of the airways or intestines. While lymphadenopathy and nodular lymphoid hyperplasia are noncancerous benign , activated PI3K delta syndrome also increases the risk of developing a form of cancer called B cell lymphoma.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Activated PI3K delta syndrome is caused by mutations in the PIK3CD gene, which provides instructions for making a protein called p110 delta p110 . This protein is one piece subunit of an enzyme called phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase PI3K , which turns on signaling pathways within cells. The version of PI3K containing the p110 subunit, called PI3K delta, is specifically found in white blood cells, including B cells and T cells. PI3K delta signaling is involved in the growth and division proliferation of white blood cells, and it helps direct B cells and T cells to mature differentiate into different types, each of which has a distinct function in the immune system. PIK3CD gene mutations involved in activated PI3K delta syndrome lead to production of an altered p110 protein. A PI3K delta enzyme containing the altered subunit is abnormally turned on activated . Studies indicate that overactive PI3K delta signaling alters the differentiation of B cells and T cells, leading to production of cells that cannot respond to infections and that die earlier than usual. Lack of functioning B cells and T cells makes it difficult for people with this disorder to fight off bacterial and viral infections. Overactivation of PI3K delta signaling can also stimulate abnormal proliferation of white blood cells, leading to lymphadenopathy and nodular lymphoid hyperplasia in some affected individuals. An increase in B cell proliferation in combination with reduced immune system function may contribute to development of B cell lymphoma.',\n",

This condition affects the bones of the spine spondylo and the ends epiphyses of long bones in the arms and legs. Congenita indicates that the condition is present from birth. People with spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita have short stature from birth, with a very short trunk and neck and shortened limbs. Their hands and feet, however, are usually average sized. Adult height ranges from 3 feet to just over 4 feet. Abnormal curvature of the spine kyphoscoliosis and lordosis becomes more severe during childhood. Instability of the spinal bones vertebrae in the neck may increase the risk of spinal cord damage. Other skeletal features include flattened vertebrae platyspondyly an abnormality of the hip joint that causes the upper leg bones to turn inward coxa vara a foot deformity called a clubfoot and a broad, barrel shaped chest. Abnormal development of the chest can cause problems with breathing. Arthritis and decreased joint mobility often develop early in life. People with spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita have mild changes in their facial features. The cheekbones close to the nose may appear flattened. Some infants are born with an opening in the roof of the mouth a cleft palate . Severe nearsightedness high myopia is common, as are other eye problems that can impair vision.

       "  'answer': 'Stevens Johnson syndrome toxic epidermal necrolysis SJS TEN is a severe skin reaction most often triggered by particular medications. Although Stevens Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis were once thought to be separate conditions, they are now considered part of a continuum. Stevens Johnson syndrome represents the less severe end of the disease spectrum, and toxic epidermal necrolysis represents the more severe end. SJS TEN often begins with a fever and flu like symptoms. Within a few days, the skin begins to blister and peel, forming very painful raw areas called erosions that resemble a severe hot water burn. The skin erosions usually start on the face and chest before spreading to other parts of the body. In most affected individuals, the condition also damages the mucous membranes, including the lining of the mouth and the airways, which can cause trouble with swallowing and breathing. The painful blistering can also affect the urinary tract and genitals. SJS TEN often affects the eyes as well, causing irritation and redness of the conjunctiva, which are the mucous membranes that protect the white part of the eye and line the eyelids, and damage to the clear front covering of the eye the cornea . Severe damage to the skin and mucous membranes makes SJS TEN a life threatening disease. Because the skin normally acts as a protective barrier, extensive skin damage can lead to a dangerous loss of fluids and allow infections to develop. Serious complications can include pneumonia, overwhelming bacterial infections sepsis , shock, multiple organ failure, and death. About 10 percent of people with Stevens Johnson syndrome die from the disease, while the condition is fatal in up to 50 percent of those with toxic epidermal necrolysis. Among people who survive, long term effects of SJS TEN can include changes in skin coloring pigmentation , dryness of the skin and mucous membranes xerosis , excess sweating hyperhidrosis , hair loss alopecia , and abnormal growth or loss of the fingernails and toenails. Other long term problems can include impaired taste, difficulty urinating, and genital abnormalities. A small percentage of affected individuals develop chronic dryness or inflammation of the eyes, which can lead to increased sensitivity to light photophobia and vision impairment.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Several genetic changes have been found to increase the risk of SJS TEN in response to triggering factors such as medications. Most of these changes occur in genes that are involved in the normal function of the immune system. The genetic variations most strongly associated with SJS TEN occur in the HLA B gene. This gene is part of a family of genes called the human leukocyte antigen HLA complex. The HLA complex helps the immune system distinguish the body s own proteins from proteins made by foreign invaders such as viruses and bacteria . The HLA B gene has many different normal variations, allowing each person s immune system to react to a wide range of foreign proteins. Certain variations in this gene occur much more often in people with SJS TEN than in people without the condition. Studies suggest that the HLA B gene variations associated with SJS TEN cause the immune system to react abnormally to certain medications. In a process that is not well understood, the drug causes immune cells called cytotoxic T cells and natural killer NK cells to release a substance called granulysin that destroys cells in the skin and mucous membranes. The death of these cells causes the blistering and peeling that is characteristic of SJS TEN. Variations in several other HLA and non HLA genes have also been studied as potential risk factors for SJS TEN. However, most people with genetic variations that increase the risk of SJS TEN never develop the disease, even if they are exposed to drugs that can trigger it. Researchers believe that additional genetic and nongenetic factors, many of which are unknown, likely play a role in whether a particular individual develops SJS TEN. The drugs most frequently associated with SJS TEN include several medications that are used to treat seizures particularly carbamazepine, lamotrigine, and phenytoin allopurinol, which is used to treat kidney stones and a form of arthritis called gout a class of antibiotic drugs called sulfonamides nevirapine, which is used to treat HIV infection and a type of non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs NSAIDs called oxicams. Other factors may also trigger SJS TEN. In particular, these skin reactions have occurred in people with an unusual form of pneumonia caused by infection with Mycoplasma pneumoniae and in people with viral infections, including cytomegalovirus. Researchers suspect that a combination of infections and drugs could contribute to the disease in some individuals. In many cases, no definitive trigger for an individual s SJS TEN is ever discovered.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Klippel Feil syndrome is a bone disorder characterized by the abnormal joining fusion of two or more spinal bones in the neck cervical vertebrae . The vertebral fusion is present from birth. Three major features result from this vertebral fusion a short neck, the resulting appearance of a low hairline at the back of the head, and a limited range of motion in the neck. Most affected people have one or two of these characteristic features. Less than half of all individuals with Klippel Feil syndrome have all three classic features of this condition. In people with Klippel Feil syndrome, the fused vertebrae can limit the range of movement of the neck and back as well as lead to chronic headaches and muscle pain in the neck and back that range in severity. People with minimal bone involvement often have fewer problems compared to individuals with several vertebrae affected. The shortened neck can cause a slight difference in the size and shape of the right and left sides of the face facial asymmetry . Trauma to the spine, such as a fall or car accident, can aggravate problems in the fused area. Fusion of the vertebrae can lead to nerve damage in the head, neck, or back. Over time, individuals with Klippel Feil syndrome can develop a narrowing of the spinal canal spinal stenosis in the neck, which can compress and damage the spinal cord. Rarely, spinal nerve abnormalities may cause abnormal sensations or involuntary movements in people with Klippel Feil syndrome. Affected individuals may develop a painful joint disorder called osteoarthritis around the areas of fused bone or experience painful involuntary tensing of the neck muscles cervical dystonia . In addition to the fused cervical bones, people with this condition may have abnormalities in other vertebrae. Many people with Klippel Feil syndrome have abnormal side to side curvature of the spine scoliosis due to malformation of the vertebrae fusion of additional vertebrae below the neck may also occur. People with Klippel Feil syndrome may have a wide variety of other features in addition to their spine abnormalities. Some people with this condition have hearing difficulties, eye abnormalities, an opening in the roof of the mouth cleft palate , genitourinary problems such as abnormal kidneys or reproductive organs, heart abnormalities, or lung defects that can cause breathing problems. Affected individuals may have other skeletal defects including arms or legs of unequal length limb length discrepancy , which can result in misalignment of the hips or knees. Additionally, the shoulder blades may be underdeveloped so that they sit abnormally high on the back, a condition called Sprengel deformity. Rarely, structural brain abnormalities or a type of birth defect that occurs during the development of the brain and spinal cord neural tube defect can occur in people with Klippel Feil syndrome. In some cases, Klippel Feil syndrome occurs as a feature of another disorder or syndrome, such as Wildervanck syndrome or hemifacial microsomia. In these instances, affected individuals have the signs and symptoms of both Klippel Feil syndrome and the additional disorder.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mutations in the GDF6, GDF3, or MEOX1 gene can cause Klippel Feil syndrome. These genes are involved in proper bone development. The protein produced from the GDF6 gene is necessary for the formation of bones and joints, including those in the spine. While the protein produced from the GDF3 gene is known to be involved in bone development, its exact role is unclear. The protein produced from the MEOX1 gene, called homeobox protein MOX 1, regulates the process that begins separating vertebrae from one another during early development. GDF6 and GDF3 gene mutations that cause Klippel Feil syndrome likely lead to reduced function of the respective proteins. MEOX1 gene mutations lead to a complete lack of homeobox protein MOX 1. Although the GDF6, GDF3, and homeobox protein MOX 1 proteins are involved in bone development, particularly formation of vertebrae, it is unclear how a shortage of one of these proteins leads to incomplete separation of the cervical vertebrae in people with Klippel Feil syndrome.

       "  'answer': 'Color vision deficiency sometimes called color blindness represents a group of conditions that affect the perception of color. Red green color vision defects are the most common form of color vision deficiency. Affected individuals have trouble distinguishing between some shades of red, yellow, and green. Blue yellow color vision defects also called tritan defects , which are rarer, cause problems with differentiating shades of blue and green and cause difficulty distinguishing dark blue from black. These two forms of color vision deficiency disrupt color perception but do not affect the sharpness of vision visual acuity . A less common and more severe form of color vision deficiency called blue cone monochromacy causes very poor visual acuity and severely reduced color vision. Affected individuals have additional vision problems, which can include increased sensitivity to light photophobia , involuntary back and forth eye movements nystagmus , and nearsightedness myopia . Blue cone monochromacy is sometimes considered to be a form of achromatopsia, a disorder characterized by a partial or total lack of color vision with other vision problems.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mutations in the OPN1LW, OPN1MW, and OPN1SW genes cause the forms of color vision deficiency described above. The proteins produced from these genes play essential roles in color vision. They are found in the retina, which is the light sensitive tissue at the back of the eye. The retina contains two types of light receptor cells, called rods and cones, that transmit visual signals from the eye to the brain. Rods provide vision in low light. Cones provide vision in bright light, including color vision. There are three types of cones, each containing a specific pigment a photopigment called an opsin that is most sensitive to particular wavelengths of light. The brain combines input from all three types of cones to produce normal color vision. The OPN1LW, OPN1MW, and OPN1SW genes provide instructions for making the three opsin pigments in cones. The opsin made from the OPN1LW gene is more sensitive to light in the yellow orange part of the visible spectrum long wavelength light , and cones with this pigment are called long wavelength sensitive or L cones. The opsin made from the OPN1MW gene is more sensitive to light in the middle of the visible spectrum yellow green light , and cones with this pigment are called middle wavelength sensitive or M cones. The opsin made from the OPN1SW gene is more sensitive to light in the blue violet part of the visible spectrum short wavelength light , and cones with this pigment are called short wavelength sensitive or S cones. Genetic changes involving the OPN1LW or OPN1MW gene cause red green color vision defects. These changes lead to an absence of L or M cones or to the production of abnormal opsin pigments in these cones that affect red green color vision. Blue yellow color vision defects result from mutations in the OPN1SW gene. These mutations lead to the premature destruction of S cones or the production of defective S cones. Impaired S cone function alters perception of the color blue, making it difficult or impossible to detect differences between shades of blue and green and causing problems with distinguishing dark blue from black. Blue cone monochromacy occurs when genetic changes affecting the OPN1LW and OPN1MW genes prevent both L and M cones from functioning normally. In people with this condition, only S cones are functional, which leads to reduced visual acuity and poor color vision. The loss of L and M cone function also underlies the other vision problems in people with blue cone monochromacy. Some problems with color vision are not caused by gene mutations. These nonhereditary conditions are described as acquired color vision deficiencies. They can be caused by other eye disorders, such as diseases involving the retina, the nerve that carries visual information from the eye to the brain the optic nerve , or areas of the brain involved in processing visual information. Acquired color vision deficiencies can also be side effects of certain drugs, such as chloroquine which is used to treat malaria , or result from exposure to particular chemicals, such as organic solvents.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Red green color vision defects and blue cone monochromacy are inherited in an X linked recessive pattern. The OPN1LW and OPN1MW genes are located on the X chromosome, which is one of the two sex chromosomes. In males who have only one X chromosome , one genetic change in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. Males are affected by X linked recessive disorders much more frequently than females because in females who have two X chromosomes , a genetic change would have to occur on both copies of the chromosome to cause the disorder. A characteristic of X linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass X linked traits to their sons. Blue yellow color vision defects are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered OPN1SW gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition.

       "  'answer': 'Complement factor I deficiency is caused by mutations in the CFI gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein called complement factor I. This protein helps regulate a part of the body s immune response known as the complement system. The complement system is a group of proteins that work together to destroy foreign invaders such as bacteria and viruses , trigger inflammation, and remove debris from cells and tissues. This system must be carefully regulated so it targets only unwanted materials and does not attack the body s healthy cells. Complement factor I and several related proteins protect healthy cells by preventing activation of the complement system when it is not needed. Mutations in the CFI gene that cause complement factor I deficiency result in abnormal, nonfunctional, or absent complement factor I. The lack deficiency of functional complement factor I protein allows uncontrolled activation of the complement system. The unregulated activity of the complement system decreases blood levels of another complement protein called C3, reducing the immune system s ability to fight infections. In addition, the immune system may malfunction and attack its own tissues, resulting in autoimmune disorders.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'LAMA2 related muscular dystrophy is a disorder that causes weakness and wasting atrophy of muscles used for movement skeletal muscles . This condition generally appears in one of two ways as a severe, early onset type or a milder, late onset form. Early onset LAMA2 related muscular dystrophy is apparent at birth or within the first few months of life. It is considered part of a class of muscle disorders called congenital muscular dystrophies and is sometimes called congenital muscular dystrophy type 1A. Affected infants have severe muscle weakness, lack of muscle tone hypotonia , little spontaneous movement, and joint deformities contractures . Weakness of the muscles in the face and throat can result in feeding difficulties and an inability to grow and gain weight at the expected rate failure to thrive . Hypotonia also affects the muscles used for breathing, which causes a weak cry and breathing problems that can lead to frequent, potentially life threatening lung infections. As affected children grow, they often develop an abnormal, gradually worsening side to side curvature of the spine scoliosis and inward curvature of the back lordosis . Children with early onset LAMA2 related muscular dystrophy usually do not learn to walk unassisted. Speech problems may result from weakness of the facial muscles and tongue, but intelligence is usually normal. Heart problems and seizures occasionally occur in early onset LAMA2 related muscular dystrophy. Because of the serious health problems that occur in this form of the disorder, many affected individuals do not survive past adolescence. Late onset LAMA2 related muscular dystrophy occurs later in childhood or in adulthood. Signs and symptoms of this form of the disorder are milder than in the early onset type and are similar to those of a group of muscle disorders classified as limb girdle muscular dystrophies. In late onset LAMA2 related muscular dystrophy, the muscles most affected are those closest to the body proximal muscles , specifically the muscles of the shoulders, upper arms, pelvic area, and thighs. Children with late onset LAMA2 related muscular dystrophy sometimes have delayed development of motor skills such as walking, but generally achieve the ability to walk without assistance. Over time, they may develop rigidity of the back, joint contractures, scoliosis, and breathing problems. However, most affected individuals retain the ability to walk and climb stairs, and life expectancy and intelligence are usually not affected in late onset LAMA2 related muscular dystrophy.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'As its name suggests, LAMA2 related muscular dystrophy is caused by mutations in the LAMA2 gene. This gene provides instructions for making a part subunit of certain members of a protein family called laminins. Laminin proteins are made of three different subunits called alpha, beta, and gamma. There are several forms of each subunit, and each form is produced from instructions carried by a different gene. The LAMA2 gene provides instructions for the alpha 2 subunit. This subunit is found in the laminin 2 protein, also known as merosin it is also part of another laminin protein called laminin 4. Laminins are found in an intricate lattice of proteins and other molecules that forms in the spaces between cells the extracellular matrix . Laminin 2 and laminin 4 play a particularly important role in the muscles used for movement skeletal muscles . The laminins attach bind to other proteins in the extracellular matrix and in the membrane of muscle cells, which helps maintain the stability of muscle fibers. Most LAMA2 gene mutations that cause the severe, early onset form of LAMA2 related muscular dystrophy result in the absence of functional laminin alpha 2 subunit. Mutations that cause the milder, later onset form usually result in a reduction deficiency of functional laminin alpha 2 subunit.

       "  'answer': 'Legg Calv Perthes disease is a bone disorder that affects the hips. Usually, only one hip is involved, but in about 10 percent of cases, both hips are affected. Legg Calv Perthes disease begins in childhood, typically between ages 4 and 8, and affects boys more frequently than girls. In this condition, the upper end of the thigh bone, known as the femoral head, breaks down. As a result, the femoral head is no longer round and does not move easily in the hip socket, which leads to hip pain, limping, and restricted leg movement. The bone eventually begins to heal itself through a normal process called bone remodeling, by which old bone is removed and new bone is created to replace it. This cycle of breakdown and healing can recur multiple times. Affected individuals are often shorter than their peers due to the bone abnormalities. Many people with Legg Calv Perthes disease go on to develop a painful joint disorder called osteoarthritis in the hips at an early age.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Legg Calv Perthes disease is usually not caused by genetic factors. The cause in these cases is unknown. In a small percentage of cases, mutations in the COL2A1 gene cause the bone abnormalities characteristic of Legg Calv Perthes disease. The COL2A1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that forms type II collagen. This type of collagen is found mostly in cartilage, a tough but flexible tissue that makes up much of the skeleton during early development. Most cartilage is later converted to bone, except for the cartilage that continues to cover and protect the ends of bones and is present in the nose and external ears. Type II collagen is essential for the normal development of bones and other connective tissues that form the body s supportive framework. COL2A1 gene mutations involved in Legg Calv Perthes disease lead to production of an altered protein collagen that contains this protein may be less stable than normal. Researchers speculate that the breakdown of bone characteristic of Legg Calv Perthes disease is caused by impaired blood flow to the femoral head, which leads to death of the bone tissue osteonecrosis however it is unclear how abnormal type II collagen is involved in this process or why the hips are specifically affected.',\n",

A lack of these hormones may affect the development of many parts of the body. The first signs of this condition include a failure to grow at the expected rate and short stature that usually becomes apparent in early childhood. People with combined pituitary hormone deficiency may have hypothyroidism, which is underactivity of the butterfly shaped thyroid gland in the lower neck. Hypothyroidism can cause many symptoms, including weight gain and fatigue. Other features of combined pituitary hormone deficiency include delayed or absent puberty and lack the ability to have biological children infertility . The condition can also be associated with a deficiency of the hormone cortisol. Cortisol deficiency can impair the body s immune system, causing individuals to be more susceptible to infection.

       "  'answer': 'Mutations in at least eight genes have been found to cause combined pituitary hormone deficiency. Mutations in the PROP1 gene are the most common known cause of this disorder, accounting for an estimated 12 to 55 percent of cases. Mutations in other genes have each been identified in a smaller number of affected individuals. The genes associated with combined pituitary hormone deficiency provide instructions for making proteins called transcription factors, which help control the activity of many other genes. The proteins are involved in the development of the pituitary gland and the specialization differentiation of its cell types. The cells of the pituitary gland are responsible for triggering the release of several hormones that direct the development of many parts of the body. Some of the transcription factors are found only in the pituitary gland, and some are also active in other parts of the body. Mutations in the genes associated with combined pituitary hormone deficiency can result in abnormal differentiation of pituitary gland cells and may prevent the production of several hormones. These hormones can include growth hormone GH , which is needed for normal growth follicle stimulating hormone FSH and luteinizing hormone LH , which both play a role in sexual development and the ability to have children fertility thyroid stimulating hormone TSH , which helps with thyroid gland function prolactin, which stimulates the production of breast milk and adrenocorticotropic hormone ACTH , which influences energy production in the body and maintains normal blood sugar and blood pressure levels. The degree to which these hormones are deficient is variable, with prolactin and ACTH showing the most variability. In many affected individuals, ACTH deficiency does not occur until late adulthood. Most people with combined pituitary hormone deficiency do not have identified mutations in any of the genes known to be associated with this condition.

       "  'answer': 'Kleefstra syndrome is caused by the loss of the EHMT1 gene or by mutations that disable its function. The EHMT1 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called euchromatic histone methyltransferase 1. Histone methyltransferases are enzymes that modify proteins called histones. Histones are structural proteins that attach bind to DNA and give chromosomes their shape. By adding a molecule called a methyl group to histones, histone methyltransferases can turn off suppress the activity of certain genes, which is essential for normal development and function. Most people with Kleefstra syndrome are missing a sequence of about 1 million DNA building blocks base pairs on one copy of chromosome 9 in each cell. The deletion occurs near the end of the long q arm of the chromosome at a location designated q34.3, a region containing the EHMT1 gene. Some affected individuals have shorter or longer deletions in the same region. The loss of the EHMT1 gene from one copy of chromosome 9 in each cell is believed to be responsible for the characteristic features of Kleefstra syndrome in people with the 9q34.3 deletion. However, the loss of other genes in the same region may lead to additional health problems in some affected individuals. About 25 percent of individuals with Kleefstra syndrome do not have a deletion of genetic material from chromosome 9 instead, these individuals have mutations in the EHMT1 gene. Some of these mutations change single protein building blocks amino acids in euchromatic histone methyltransferase 1. Others create a premature stop signal in the instructions for making the enzyme or alter the way the gene s instructions are pieced together to produce the enzyme. These changes generally result in an enzyme that is unstable and decays rapidly, or that is disabled and cannot function properly. Either a deletion or a mutation affecting the EHMT1 gene results in a lack of functional euchromatic histone methyltransferase 1 enzyme. A lack of this enzyme impairs proper control of the activity of certain genes in many of the body s organs and tissues, resulting in the abnormalities of development and function characteristic of Kleefstra syndrome.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'The inheritance of Kleefstra syndrome is considered to be autosomal dominant because a deletion in one copy of chromosome 9 in each cell or a mutation in one copy of the EHMT1 gene is sufficient to cause the condition. Most cases of Kleefstra syndrome are not inherited, however. The genetic change occurs most often as a random event during the formation of reproductive cells eggs or sperm or in early fetal development. Affected people typically have no history of the disorder in their family, though they can pass the disorder on to their children. Only a few people with Kleefstra syndrome have been known to reproduce. Rarely, affected individuals inherit a chromosome 9 with a deleted segment from an unaffected parent. In these cases, the parent carries a chromosomal rearrangement called a balanced translocation, in which no genetic material is gained or lost. Balanced translocations usually do not cause any health problems however, they can become unbalanced as they are passed to the next generation. Children who inherit an unbalanced translocation can have a chromosomal rearrangement with extra or missing genetic material. Individuals with Kleefstra syndrome who inherit an unbalanced translocation are missing genetic material from the long arm of chromosome 9. A few individuals with Kleefstra syndrome have inherited the chromosome 9q34.3 deletion from an unaffected parent who is mosaic for the deletion. Mosaic means that an individual has the deletion in some cells including some sperm or egg cells , but not in others.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Lafora progressive myoclonus epilepsy is a brain disorder characterized by recurrent seizures epilepsy and a decline in intellectual function. The signs and symptoms of the disorder usually appear in late childhood or adolescence and worsen with time. Myoclonus is a term used to describe episodes of sudden, involuntary muscle jerking or twitching that can affect part of the body or the entire body. Myoclonus can occur when an affected person is at rest, and it is made worse by motion, excitement, or flashing light photic stimulation . In the later stages of Lafora progressive myoclonus epilepsy, myoclonus often occurs continuously and affects the entire body. Several types of seizures commonly occur in people with Lafora progressive myoclonus epilepsy. Generalized tonic clonic seizures also known as grand mal seizures affect the entire body, causing muscle rigidity, convulsions, and loss of consciousness. Affected individuals may also experience occipital seizures, which can cause temporary blindness and visual hallucinations. Over time, the seizures worsen and become more difficult to treat. A life threatening seizure condition called status epilepticus may also develop. Status epilepticus is a continuous state of seizure activity lasting longer than several minutes. About the same time seizures begin, intellectual function starts to decline. Behavioral changes, depression, confusion, and speech difficulties dysarthria are among the early signs and symptoms of this disorder. As the condition progresses, a continued loss of intellectual function dementia impairs memory, judgment, and thought. Affected people lose the ability to perform the activities of daily living by their mid twenties, and they ultimately require comprehensive care. People with Lafora progressive myoclonus epilepsy generally survive up to 10 years after symptoms first appear.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Lafora progressive myoclonus epilepsy can be caused by mutations in either the EPM2A gene or the NHLRC1 gene. These genes provide instructions for making proteins called laforin and malin, respectively. Laforin and malin play a critical role in the survival of nerve cells neurons in the brain. Studies suggest that laforin and malin work together and may have several functions. One of these is to help regulate the production of a complex sugar called glycogen, which is a major source of stored energy in the body. The body stores this sugar in the liver and muscles, breaking it down when it is needed for fuel. Laforin and malin may prevent a potentially damaging buildup of glycogen in tissues that do not normally store this molecule, such as those of the nervous system. Researchers have discovered that people with Lafora progressive myoclonus epilepsy have distinctive clumps called Lafora bodies within their cells. Lafora bodies are made up of an abnormal form of glycogen that cannot be broken down and used for fuel. Instead, it builds up to form clumps that can damage cells. Neurons appear to be particularly vulnerable to this type of damage. Although Lafora bodies are found in many of the body s tissues, the signs and symptoms of Lafora progressive myoclonus epilepsy are limited to the nervous system. Mutations in the EPM2A gene prevent cells from making functional laforin, while NHLRC1 gene mutations prevent the production of functional malin. It is unclear how a loss of either of these proteins leads to the formation of Lafora bodies. However, a loss of laforin or malin ultimately results in the death of neurons, which interferes with the brain s normal functions. The condition tends to progress more slowly in some people with NHLRC1 gene mutations than in those with EPM2A gene mutations. Mutations in the EPM2A and NHLRC1 genes account for 80 percent to 90 percent of all cases of Lafora progressive myoclonus epilepsy. In the remaining cases, the cause of the condition is unknown. Researchers are searching for other genetic changes that may underlie this disease.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Cone rod dystrophy is a group of related eye disorders that causes vision loss, which becomes more severe over time. These disorders affect the retina, which is the layer of light sensitive tissue at the back of the eye. In people with cone rod dystrophy, vision loss occurs as the light sensing cells of the retina gradually deteriorate. The first signs and symptoms of cone rod dystrophy, which often occur in childhood, are usually decreased sharpness of vision visual acuity and increased sensitivity to light photophobia . These features are typically followed by impaired color vision dyschromatopsia , blind spots scotomas in the center of the visual field, and partial side peripheral vision loss. Over time, affected individuals develop night blindness and a worsening of their peripheral vision, which can limit independent mobility. Decreasing visual acuity makes reading increasingly difficult and most affected individuals are legally blind by mid adulthood. As the condition progresses, individuals may develop involuntary eye movements nystagmus . There are more than 30 types of cone rod dystrophy, which are distinguished by their genetic cause and their pattern of inheritance autosomal recessive, autosomal dominant, or X linked each of which is described below . Additionally, cone rod dystrophy can occur alone without any other signs and symptoms or it can occur as part of a syndrome that affects multiple parts of the body.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mutations in approximately 30 genes are known to cause cone rod dystrophy. Approximately 20 of these genes are associated with the form of cone rod dystrophy that is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. Mutations in the ABCA4 gene are the most common cause of autosomal recessive cone rod dystrophy, accounting for 30 to 60 percent of cases. At least 10 genes have been associated with cone rod dystrophy that is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. Mutations in the GUCY2D and CRX genes account for about half of these cases. Changes in at least two genes cause the X linked form of the disorder, which is rare. The genes associated with cone rod dystrophy play essential roles in the structure and function of specialized light receptor cells photoreceptors in the retina. The retina contains two types of photoreceptors, rods and cones. Rods are needed for vision in low light, while cones provide vision in bright light, including color vision. Mutations in any of the genes associated with cone rod dystrophy lead to a gradual loss of rods and cones in the retina. The progressive degeneration of these cells causes the characteristic pattern of vision loss that occurs in people with cone rod dystrophy. Cones typically break down before rods, which is why sensitivity to light and impaired color vision are usually the first signs of the disorder. The order of cell breakdown is also reflected in the condition name. Night vision is disrupted later, as rods are lost. Some of the genes associated with cone rod dystrophy are also associated with other eye diseases, including a group of related eye disorders called rod cone dystrophy. Rod cone dystrophy has signs and symptoms similar to those of cone rod dystrophy. However, rod cone dystrophy is characterized by deterioration of the rods first, followed by the cones, so night vision is affected before daylight and color vision. The most common form of rod cone dystrophy is a condition called retinitis pigmentosa.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Cone rod dystrophy is usually inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition. Less frequently, this condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In most of these cases, an affected person has one parent with the condition. Rarely, cone rod dystrophy is inherited in an X linked recessive pattern. The genes associated with this form of the condition are located on the X chromosome, which is one of the two sex chromosomes. In males who have only one X chromosome , one altered copy of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. In females who have two X chromosomes , a mutation would have to occur in both copies of the gene to cause the disorder. Because it is unlikely that females will have two altered copies of this gene, males are affected by X linked recessive disorders much more frequently than females. Females with one copy of the altered gene have mild vision problems, such as decreased visual acuity. A characteristic of X linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass X linked traits to their sons.',\n",

This condition begins in childhood or adolescence, usually between ages 12 and 18, and lasts into adulthood. The most common type of seizure in people with this condition is myoclonic seizures, which cause rapid, uncontrolled muscle jerks. People with this condition may also have generalized tonic clonic seizures also known as grand mal seizures , which cause muscle rigidity, convulsions, and loss of consciousness. Sometimes, affected individuals have absence seizures, which cause loss of consciousness for a short period that appears as a staring spell. Typically, people with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy develop the characteristic myoclonic seizures in adolescence, then develop generalized tonic clonic seizures a few years later. Although seizures can happen at any time, they occur most commonly in the morning, shortly after awakening. Seizures can be triggered by a lack of sleep, extreme tiredness, stress, or alcohol consumption.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'The genetics of juvenile myoclonic epilepsy are complex and not completely understood. Mutations in one of several genes can cause or increase susceptibility to this condition. The most studied of these genes are the GABRA1 gene and the EFHC1 gene, although mutations in at least three other genes have been identified in people with this condition. Many people with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy do not have mutations in any of these genes. Changes in other, unidentified genes are likely involved in this condition. A mutation in the GABRA1 gene has been identified in several members of a large family with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. The GABRA1 gene provides instructions for making one piece, the alpha 1 1 subunit, of the GABAA receptor protein. The GABAA receptor acts as a channel that allows negatively charged chlorine atoms chloride ions to cross the cell membrane. After infancy, the influx of chloride ions creates an environment in the cell that inhibits signaling between nerve cells neurons and prevents the brain from being overloaded with too many signals. Mutations in the GABRA1 gene lead to an altered 1 subunit and a decrease in the number of GABAA receptors available. As a result, the signaling between neurons is not controlled, which can lead to overstimulation of neurons. Researchers believe that the overstimulation of certain neurons in the brain triggers the abnormal brain activity associated with seizures. Mutations in the EFHC1 gene have been associated with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy in a small number of people. The EFHC1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that also plays a role in neuron activity, although its function is not completely understood. The EFHC1 protein is attached to another protein that acts as a calcium channel. This protein allows positively charged calcium ions to cross the cell membrane. The movement of these ions is critical for normal signaling between neurons. The EFHC1 protein is thought to help regulate the balance of calcium ions inside the cell, although the mechanism is unclear. In addition, studies show that the EFHC1 protein may be involved in the self destruction of cells. EFHC1 gene mutations reduce the function of the EFHC1 protein. Researchers suggest that this reduction causes an increase in the number of neurons and disrupts the calcium balance. Together, these effects may lead to overstimulation of neurons and trigger seizures.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Thrombocytopenia absent radius TAR syndrome is characterized by the absence of a bone called the radius in each forearm. Affected individuals also have a shortage deficiency of blood cells involved in clotting platelets . This platelet deficiency thrombocytopenia usually appears during infancy and becomes less severe over time in some cases the platelet levels become normal. Thrombocytopenia prevents normal blood clotting, resulting in easy bruising and frequent nosebleeds. Potentially life threatening episodes of severe bleeding hemorrhages may occur in the brain and other organs, especially during the first year of life. Hemorrhages can damage the brain and lead to intellectual disability. Affected children who survive this period and do not have damaging hemorrhages in the brain usually have a normal life expectancy and normal intellectual development. TAR syndrome is unusual among similar malformations in that affected individuals have thumbs, while people with other conditions involving an absent radius typically do not. TAR syndrome is also associated with short stature and additional skeletal abnormalities, including underdevelopment of other bones in the arms and legs. Affected individuals may also have malformations of the heart and kidneys. TAR syndrome is associated with unusual facial features including a small lower jaw micrognathia , a prominent forehead, and low set ears.

       "  'answer': 'Mutations in the RBM8A gene cause TAR syndrome. The RBM8A gene provides instructions for making a protein called RNA binding motif protein 8A. This protein is believed to be involved in several important cellular functions involving the production of other proteins. Most people with TAR syndrome have a mutation in one copy of the RBM8A gene and a deletion of genetic material from chromosome 1 that includes the other copy of the RBM8A gene in each cell. A small number of affected individuals have mutations in both copies of the RBM8A gene in each cell and do not have a deletion on chromosome 1. RBM8A gene mutations that cause TAR syndrome reduce the amount of RNA binding motif protein 8A in cells. The deletions involved in TAR syndrome eliminate at least 200,000 DNA building blocks 200 kilobases, or 200 kb from the long q arm of chromosome 1 in a region called 1q21.1. The deletion eliminates one copy of the RBM8A gene in each cell and the RNA binding motif protein 8A that would have been produced from it. People with either an RBM8A gene mutation and a chromosome 1 deletion or with two gene mutations have a decreased amount of RNA binding motif protein 8A. This reduction is thought to cause problems in the development of certain tissues, but it is unknown how it causes the specific signs and symptoms of TAR syndrome. No cases have been reported in which a deletion that includes the RBM8A gene occurs on both copies of chromosome 1 studies indicate that the complete loss of RNA binding motif protein 8A is not compatible with life. Researchers sometimes refer to the deletion in chromosome 1 associated with TAR syndrome as the 200 kb deletion to distinguish it from another chromosomal abnormality called a 1q21.1 microdeletion. People with a 1q21.1 microdeletion are missing a different, larger DNA segment in the chromosome 1q21.1 region near the area where the 200 kb deletion occurs. The chromosomal change related to 1q21.1 microdeletion is often called the recurrent distal 1.35 Mb deletion.',\n",

Additional skeletal problems occur because of abnormalities of the tough, flexible tissue called cartilage that makes up much of the skeleton during early development. Individuals with SPENCDI often have areas where cartilage did not convert to bone. They may also have noncancerous growths of cartilage enchondromas . The bone and cartilage problems contribute to short stature in people with SPENCDI. Individuals with SPENCDI have a combination of immune system problems. Many affected individuals have malfunctioning immune systems that attack the body s own tissues and organs, which is known as an autoimmune reaction. The malfunctioning immune system can lead to a variety of disorders, such as a decrease in blood cells called platelets thrombocytopenia , premature destruction of red blood cells hemolytic anemia , an underactive thyroid gland hypothyroidism , or chronic inflammatory disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus or rheumatoid arthritis. In addition, affected individuals often have abnormal immune cells that cannot grow and divide in response to harmful invaders such as bacteria and viruses. As a result of this immune deficiency, these individuals have frequent fevers and recurrent respiratory infections. Some people with SPENCDI have neurological problems such as abnormal muscle stiffness spasticity , difficulty with coordinating movements ataxia , and intellectual disability. They may also have abnormal deposits of calcium calcification in the brain. Due to the range of immune system problems, people with SPENCDI typically have a shortened life expectancy, but figures vary widely.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Mutations in the ACP5 gene cause SPENCDI. This gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called tartrate resistant acid phosphatase type 5 TRAP . The TRAP enzyme primarily regulates the activity of a protein called osteopontin, which is produced in bone cells called osteoclasts and in immune cells. Osteopontin performs a variety of functions in these cells. Osteoclasts are specialized cells that break down and remove resorb bone tissue that is no longer needed. These cells are involved in bone remodeling, which is a normal process that replaces old bone tissue with new bone. During bone remodeling, osteopontin is turned on activated , allowing osteoclasts to attach bind to bones. When the breakdown of bone is complete, TRAP turns off inactivates osteopontin, causing the osteoclasts to release themselves from bone. In immune system cells, osteopontin helps fight infection by promoting inflammation, regulating immune cell activity, and turning on various immune system cells that are necessary to fight off foreign invaders. As in bone cells, the TRAP enzyme inactivates osteopontin in immune cells when it is no longer needed. The ACP5 gene mutations that cause SPENCDI impair or eliminate TRAP s ability to inactivate osteopontin. As a result, osteopontin is abnormally active, prolonging bone breakdown by osteoclasts and triggering abnormal inflammation and immune responses by immune cells. In people with SPENCDI, increased bone remodeling contributes to the skeletal abnormalities, including irregularly shaped bones and short stature. An overactive immune system leads to increased susceptibility to autoimmune disorders and impairs the body s normal immune response to harmful invaders, resulting in frequent infections. The mechanism that leads to the other features of SPENCDI, including movement disorders and intellectual disability, is currently unknown.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Stargardt macular degeneration is a genetic eye disorder that causes progressive vision loss. This disorder affects the retina, the specialized light sensitive tissue that lines the back of the eye. Specifically, Stargardt macular degeneration affects a small area near the center of the retina called the macula. The macula is responsible for sharp central vision, which is needed for detailed tasks such as reading, driving, and recognizing faces. In most people with Stargardt macular degeneration, a fatty yellow pigment lipofuscin builds up in cells underlying the macula. Over time, the abnormal accumulation of this substance can damage cells that are critical for clear central vision. In addition to central vision loss, people with Stargardt macular degeneration have problems with night vision that can make it difficult to navigate in low light. Some affected individuals also have impaired color vision. The signs and symptoms of Stargardt macular degeneration typically appear in late childhood to early adulthood and worsen over time.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'In most cases, Stargardt macular degeneration is caused by mutations in the ABCA4 gene. Less often, mutations in the ELOVL4 gene cause this condition. The ABCA4 and ELOVL4 genes provide instructions for making proteins that are found in light sensing photoreceptor cells in the retina. The ABCA4 protein transports potentially toxic substances out of photoreceptor cells. These substances form after phototransduction, the process by which light entering the eye is converted into electrical signals that are transmitted to the brain. Mutations in the ABCA4 gene prevent the ABCA4 protein from removing toxic byproducts from photoreceptor cells. These toxic substances build up and form lipofuscin in the photoreceptor cells and the surrounding cells of the retina, eventually causing cell death. Loss of cells in the retina causes the progressive vision loss characteristic of Stargardt macular degeneration. The ELOVL4 protein plays a role in making a group of fats called very long chain fatty acids. The ELOVL4 protein is primarily active expressed in the retina, but is also expressed in the brain and skin. The function of very long chain fatty acids within the retina is unknown. Mutations in the ELOVL4 gene lead to the formation of ELOVL4 protein clumps aggregates that build up and may interfere with retinal cell functions, ultimately leading to cell death.',\n",
